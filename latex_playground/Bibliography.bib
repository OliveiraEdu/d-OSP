            The demand for open data and open science is on the rise, fueled by expectations from the scientific community, calls to increase transparency and reproducibility in research findings, and developments such as the Final Data Management and Sharing Policy from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and a memorandum on increasing public access to federally funded research, issued by the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy. This paper explores the pivotal role of data repositories in biomedical research and open science, emphasizing their importance in managing, preserving, and sharing research data. Our objective is to familiarize readers with the functions of data repositories, set expectations for their services, and provide an overview of methods to evaluate their capabilities. The paper serves to introduce fundamental concepts and community-based guiding principles and aims to equip researchers, repository operators, funders, and policymakers with the knowledge to select appropriate repositories for their data management and sharing needs and foster a foundation for the open sharing and preservation of research data.},

	abstract = {The GO FAIR Initiative was jointly launched in December 2017 by the Dutch, German and French governments to provide support and coordination to the many diverse stakeholders committed to building Internet resources based on the 15 FAIR Principles. GO FAIR is bottom-up stakeholder governed and focused on implementations (use cases, prototypes, demonstrators, pilots). Because practical implementation implies technology choices and the adoption of community standards, GO FAIR operates via Implementation Networks, which are voluntary associations of stakeholders committing to specific technologies (GO BUILD Pillar), training and education curricula (GO TRAIN Pillar) and systemic changes within organisations that include policy, mandates, budgeting, and incentives (GO CHANGE Pillar). The GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office attempts to maximise synergies between INs and prevent the re-invention of the wheel. Presently, there are about 15 INs covering the 3 Pillars, composed of more than 300 organisations from around the world. Erik will give an update on how the GO CHANGE Community is combining existing resources such as FAIR Metrics, Data Stewardship Planning tools and Metadata platforms to make it possible for research funders, research organisations and scientific publishers to mandate, monitor, and reward compliance with the FAIR Principles. By defining an ecosystem of FAIR Data and Services, it becomes possible for researchers to prioritise their efforts toward better stewardship of all their research objects.},

            There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

	abstract = {The Open Science movement has gained considerable traction in the last decade. The Open Science movement tries to increase trust in research results and open the access to all elements of a research project to the public. Central to these goals, Open Science has promoted five critical tenets: Open Data, Open Analysis, Open Materials, Preregistration, and Open Access. All Open Science elements can be thought of as extensions to the traditional way of achieving openness in science, which has been scientific publication of research outcomes in journals or books. Open Science in education sciences, however, has the potential to be much more than a safeguard against questionable research. Open Science in education science provides opportunities to (a) increase the transparency and therefore replicability of research and (b) develop and answer research questions about individuals with learning disabilities and learning difficulties that were previously impossible to answer due to complexities in data analysis methods. We will provide overviews of the main tenets of Open Science (i.e., Open Data, Open Analysis, Open Materials, Preregistration, and Open Access), show how they are in line with grant funding agencies’ expectations for rigorous research processes, and present resources on best practices for each of the tenets.},

	abstract = {Scientific publication is immensely important to the scientific endeavour. There is, however, concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive, allowing careless and fraudulent conduct to thrive, compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel, positive findings rather than investigations confirming null hypothesis. This potentially compounds a reproducibility crisis in several fields, and risks undermining science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little modelling on factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. We present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists, with funding allocated by published outputs. This analysis suggests that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is influenced by false positive rate, and pressures for positive results. We find decreasing available funding has negative consequences for resulting trustworthiness, and examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science.},

            When talking about blockchain technology in academia, business, and society, frequently generalizations are still heared about its – supposedly inherent – enormous energy consumption. This perception inevitably raises concerns about the further adoption of blockchain technology, a fact that inhibits rapid uptake of what is widely considered to be a groundbreaking and disruptive innovation. However, blockchain technology is far from homogeneous, meaning that blanket statements about its energy consumption should be reviewed with care. The article is meant to bring clarity to the topic in a holistic fashion, looking beyond claims regarding the energy consumption of Bitcoin, which have, so far, dominated the discussion.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, research into blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly due to an increase in media coverage. Many different blockchain applications and platforms have been developed for different purposes, such as food safety monitoring, cryptocurrency exchange, and secure medical data sharing. However, blockchain platforms cannot store all the generated data. Therefore, they are supported with data warehouses, which in turn is called a hybrid blockchain platform. While several systems have been developed based on this idea, a current state-of-the-art systematic overview on the use of hybrid blockchain platforms is lacking. Therefore, a systematic literature review (SLR) study has been carried out by us to investigate the motivations for adopting them, the domains at which they were used, the adopted technologies that made this integration effective, and, finally, the challenges and possible solutions. This study shows that security, transparency, and efficiency are the top three motivations for adopting these platforms. The energy, agriculture, health, construction, manufacturing, and supply chain domains are the top domains. The most adopted technologies are cloud computing, fog computing, telecommunications, and edge computing. While there are several benefits of using hybrid blockchains, there are also several challenges reported in this study.},

abstract = {The concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.},

    abstract = {Permissionless blockchains require a protocol to generate consensus. Many prominent permissionless blockchains employ Proof-of-Work (PoW) for that purpose, but PoW possesses significant shortcomings. Various alternatives have been proposed. This paper provides the first formal economic model of the most famous alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and establishes conditions under which PoS generates consensus. A sufficiently modest reward schedule not only implies the existence of an equilibrium in which consensus obtains as soon as possible but also precludes a persistent forking equilibrium. The latter result arises because PoS, unlike PoW, requires that validators are also stakeholders.},
