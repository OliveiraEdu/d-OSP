% This class provides new commands for type-setting `yellow' notes.
%
% This class IS NOT re-distributable.  Only members of the TDG are allowed to
% use it.  If you happen to have this file, please, use it at your own risk.
% No support is available.  Don't send me e-mail asking me about RC-Notes.
% A day, RC-Notes will be made available to LaTeX users, but that day still
% has to come!

% alpha v0.0 2012/31/05
%
% New features
%   - There are three new commands called \dontforget, \comment, and \checkthis
%     that are intended to produce annotations while working on a document.
%     There's an additional command called \todo, which is like \dontforget, but
%     prepends your text with ``TODO:''.

% alpha v2.14 2012/08/31
%
% Fixed bugs, I mean... features
%
%   - The support for multiple co-existing versions of RC-BooK has been improved.
