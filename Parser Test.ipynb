To this end, we present a framework for airfoil shape optimization\\nto reduce the trailing edge noise for the design of wind turbine blades. Far-field noise is evaluated using\\nAmiet\\u2019s theory coupled with the TNO-Blake model to calculate the wall pressure spectrum and fast turn-around\\nXFOIL simulations to evaluate the boundary layer parameters. The computational framework is first validated\\nusing a NACA0012 airfoil at 0\\u25e6 angle of attack. Particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimized\\nairfoil configuration. The multi-objective optimization minimizes the A-weighted overall sound pressure level\\nat various angles of attack, while ensuring enough lift and minimum drag. Furthermore, traditional shape\\noptimization techniques show difficulties to converge to the optimum, when too many shape parameters are\\nincluded in the optimization. For this reason, we compare classic parameterization methods to define the\\nairfoil geometry (i.e., CST) to a machine learning method (i.e., a variational autoencoder). We observe that\\nvariational autoencoders can represent a wide variety of geometries, with only four encoded variables, leading\\nto efficient optimizations, which result in improved optimal shapes. When compared to the baseline geometry, a\\nNACA0012, the autoencoder-based optimized airfoil reduces by 3% (1.75 dBA) the overall sound pressure level\\n(with decreased noise across the entire frequency range), while maintaining favorable aerodynamic properties\\nin terms of lift and drag.\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nWind turbine noise has typically been one of the main drawbacks of\\nthe wide deployment and acceptance of wind devices for the generation\\nof clean energy. The interest in controlling turbine acoustics is increas-\\ning since turbines are now being integrated in urban environments,\\nwhere noise nuisances can be of great concern (Hubbard & Shepherd,\\n2009; Rogers, Manwell, & Wright, 2006). Wind turbine aeroacoustics is\\na complex phenomenon that includes several sources of noise. The most\\ncritical noise sources of a typical wind turbine are: (1) steady loading,\\nwhich relates to the distribution of forces along the blade leading to\\nbroadband noise; (2) unsteady loading caused by the incoming sheared\\nand turbulent atmospheric flow, associated with low frequency noise;\\nand (3) airfoil self-noise, which encompasses various high frequency\\nphenomena that relate to the boundary layer and eddies generated as\\nthe air passes the blades.\\n\\nAirfoil self-noise (Brooks, Pope, & Marcolini, 1989) is the minimum\\namount of noise produced by an aerodynamic surface and is the main\\n\\n\\u2217 Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: jiaqing.kou@alumnos.upm.es (J.

It is caused by the interaction of the turbulent boundary\\nlayer with the blade surface close to the trailing edge, when the\\nhydrodynamic pressure fluctuations originated in the airfoil surface\\nare scattered to the far field as noise, due to the sudden change of\\nimpedance in the blade trailing edge discontinuity (Stalnov, Chaitanya,\\n& Joseph, 2016). To generate quiet wind turbines, it is necessary\\nto select airfoils that minimize noise generation in operational con-\\nditions (e.g. attached flow). Typical turbine airfoils were designed\\nto be insensitive to roughness, by promoting the transition near the\\nleading edge (Bertagnolio, S\\u00f8rensen, Johansen, & Fuglsang, 2001),\\nwhile noise generation was often neglected. However, social pressure\\nto minimize wind farm noise leads to considering acoustics during\\nthe design phase of new airfoils. The SIROCO project (Humpf, Ferrer,\\n& Munduate, 2007; Lutz, Herrig, W\\u00fcrz, Kamruzzaman, & Kr\\u00e4mer,\\n2007; Schepers et al., 2007) incorporated aeroacoustic predictions for\\nshape optimization design.

Kou et al.\\n\\nt\\nd\\ns\\na\\ns\\ni\\n\\npredict airfoil trailing edge far-field noise, by combining XFOIL, a\\nfinite-difference code, and a modified TNO-TPD model. The method\\nhas been used to design new, less-noisy airfoils without loss in aero-\\ndynamic performance. Similarly, Hao, Zhang, Liu, and Liu (2008)\\nintroduced aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimization of the wind\\nturbine blade using a genetic algorithm. Lee, Lee, Ryi, and Choi (2013)\\noptimized the airfoils of the wind turbine based on genetic algorithms,\\nto reduce airfoil self-noise, and validated the results by wind tunnel\\nexperiment. Rodrigues and Marta (2014) performed multi-objective op-\\ntimization to design wind turbine blades, where an increase in annual\\nenergy production of 15% was achieved with a reduction in noise levels\\nof 9.8%. Zhou et al. (2015) proposed a discrete adjoint framework\\nfor unsteady aerodynamic aeroacoustic optimization. More recently,\\nVolkmer and Carolus (2018) performed aeroacoustic airfoil shape opti-\\nmization based on semi-empirical aeroacoustic models. There, XFOIL\\nis combined with Amiet\\u2019s model and evolutionary optimization to\\ndesign airfoils with less noise while maintaining the required lift. Ricks,\\nTsirikoglou, Contino, and Ghorbaniasl (2020) proposed multi-objective\\naerodynamic-aeroacoustic shape optimization of airfoils based on a\\nReynolds-averaged Navier\\u2013Stokes solver with a state-of-the-art wall\\npressure spectrum model and Amiet\\u2019s model for trailing edge noise. Bu,\\nSong, Han, Zhang, and Zhang (2020) developed the framework for\\naerodynamic/aeroacoustic variable-fidelity optimization of helicopter\\nrotor based on hierarchical Kriging model. These works show the effi-\\nciency of using Amiet\\u2019s theory and XFOIL for aeroacoustic optimization,\\nwhereas recent machine learning strategies (e.g., autoencoders) have\\nnot been considered.\\n\\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are permeating in all fields of\\nfluid dynamics (Brunton & Kutz, 2019; Garnier et al., 2021; Kou\\n& Zhang, 2021; leClainche et al., 2022; Vinuesa & Brunton, 2022;\\nYondo, Andr\\u00e9s, & Valero, 2018) and aerodynamic optimization; see\\nthe recent review by Li, Du, and Martins (2022). ML can be used as\\na surrogate model to replace the expensive flow simulations (Sun &\\nWang, 2019). For example, Boutemedjet, Samard\\u017ei\\u0107, Rebhi, Raji\\u0107, and\\nMouada (2019) proposed the aerodynamic design procedure of a mini\\nunmanned aerial vehicle involving genetic algorithms and artificial\\nneural networks for wing preliminary computation. Liao, Song, Du, and\\nZhao (2021) introduced multi-fidelity convolutional neural networks as\\na surrogate model for aerodynamic optimization. Moreover, Yan, Zhu,\\nKuang, and Wang (2019) developed an optimizer based on reinforce-\\nment learning and transfer learning, to enhance aerodynamic shape\\noptimization.\\n\\nIn particular, unsupervised ML techniques for dimensionality reduc-\\ntion enable the treatment of problems with a large number of variables\\nby coding the information into a reduced number of parameters (i.e., la-\\ntent variables). Neural networks are ideal for representing nonlinear\\nfunctions and can thus encode information very efficiently in very\\nfew latent variables. Autoencoders (AEs) are artificial neural networks\\nthat can reduce the dataset information (encoding), but that can also\\nreconstruct (decode) the original data, minimizing the reconstruction\\nerror. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) improve the behavior of classic\\nautoencoders by enforcing latent variables to follow smooth statistical\\ndistributions (typically normal distributions) (Kingma & Welling, 2013;\\nZhao, Song, & Ermon, 2017). By doing so, it is possible to avoid discon-\\ntinuities in the latent variables, which helps to reconstruct the original\\ndatabase. Another advantage of requiring smooth latent variables is\\nthat they can be used for optimization.\\n\\nVAEs have not been widely adopted for optimization. In fact, to\\nthe authors\\u2019 knowledge, only Rios et al. (2021) have used VAEs\\nfor car optimization. They showed the superiority of this technique\\nin incorporating local geometric features, when compared to modal\\ntechniques (e.g., principal component analysis). Additionally, Yonekura\\nand Suzuki (2021) have shown the advantages of VAEs to represent\\nairfoils using latent variables, but did not perform optimizations.\\n\\nEncouraged by the previous work, in this work we propose using\\nVAEs to enhance the aeroacoustic optimization of wind turbine air-\\n2\\n\\nfoils. We target the airfoil self-noise using Amiet\\u2019s theory and develop\\nan optimization framework that targets improved aerodynamics with\\nminimum noise in the design. We include VAEs for the parameteri-\\nzation of the airfoil geometry and compare this technique with the\\nCST method (Kulfan & Bussoletti, 2006) to parameterize the airfoil\\ngeometry. Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed framework, including the\\ninputs and outputs, as well as the basic workflow of the optimization\\nframework. As will be shown in the results, VAEs show superiority and\\nenhanced robustness over CST. The main contributions of this work\\nare: (1) We develop a framework for aeroacoustic shape optimization;\\n(2) We incorporate autoencoders to enhance shape parameterization.\\nThe results show the superior capabilities of the aeroacoustic shape\\noptimization framework when enhanced by autoencoders.\\n\\nThe remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in-\\ntroduces the far-field noise prediction framework, including the aeroa-\\ncoustic and aerodynamic models, as well as the validation of the\\nframework. The optimization framework is introduced in Section 3,\\nwhere the shape parameterization including CST and VAEs, the op-\\ntimization algorithm, and the problem formulation are detailed. The\\noptimization results are summarized in Section 4. Conclusions are\\nprovided in Section 5.\\n\\n2. Far-field noise prediction\\n\\nThis section introduces the computational models used in the\\npresent study, including the aerodynamic and acoustic models. Amiet\\u2019s\\ntheory (Amiet, 1976) is adopted here for the trailing edge noise pre-\\ndiction. The theory calculates the far-field acoustic pressure spectrum\\nusing the wall pressure wavenumber\\u2013frequency spectral density in the\\nvicinity of the trailing edge as input. This theory assumes a large span,\\na stationary observer and airfoil, and a uniform flow, and that the\\nboundary layer turbulence is convecting over the trailing edge as a\\nfrozen pattern, i.e., the turbulence is not affected by the discontinuity\\nof the trailing edge.\\n\\n2.1.

Moreover, update the particle (i.e., design variables for the\\nevaluation in the next generation) based on the PSO algorithm.

Aeroacoustic shape optimization framework.\\n\\n3.1. Problem formulation: optimization objective and constraints\\n\\nIn this study, we are interested in geometric optimization for noise\\nminimization. Therefore, the Overall A-weighted Sound Pressure Level\\n(OASPL) is selected as the objective function. The OASPL is used to\\nweight the spectrum energy in the frequency domain with the sensi-\\ntivity of human hearing, resulting in optimized geometries suitable for\\nwind turbines located near urban areas. Since the optimized airfoil is\\nexpected to work on multiple operating conditions, the multi-objective\\noptimization is needed. Therefore, we formulated this problem by\\nconsidering the overall OASPL for various angles of attack (AOAs)\\nas the objective function. Meanwhile, to maintain reasonable aero-\\ndynamic performance and reasonable geometries, several constraints\\nshould be satisfied. Therefore, the following objective and constraints\\nare selected:\\n\\nmin\\n\\ud835\\udc4f\\u2215\\ud835\\udc67\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc60\\n\\u2211\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc56=1\\n\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc3f(\\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc42\\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc56), (3)\\n\\nsubject to \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56 \\u2265 \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc590,\\ud835\\udc56 ; \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc51,\\ud835\\udc56 \\u2264 \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc510,\\ud835\\udc56,\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc47 \\u2264 \\ud835\\udc470,\\n\\nmin(\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65) \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc64\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65)) > 0 ; 0 < \\ud835\\udc65 < 1,\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc47Leading \\u2265 \\ud835\\udc47Trailing.\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc4f and \\ud835\\udc67 refer to the CST parameters or the latent variable\\nof the autoencoder. \\ud835\\udc47 refers to the maximal thickness of the airfoil.\\nThe sum of OASPL at the \\ud835\\udc60 angle of attack is used to evaluate the\\nobjective function. The parameter with subscript 0 refers to the baseline\\ngeometry, where the NACA0012 airfoil is chosen for all angles of attack.\\nTo maintain reasonable aerodynamic performance, we do not expect\\na drop in lift or an increase in drag, compared to the baseline case.\\n4\\n\\nTherefore, the first group of constraints is imposed: \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc59,\\ud835\\udc56 \\u2265 \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc590,\\ud835\\udc56, \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc51,\\ud835\\udc56 \\u2264\\n\\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc510,\\ud835\\udc56, where \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc590 and \\ud835\\udc36\\ud835\\udc510 refer to the lift and drag coefficients of the\\nbaseline geometry, respectively. The constraint applies to all AOAs\\nconsidered during optimization. All of them are hard constraints that\\nmust be satisfied during the optimization process; therefore, a suit-\\nable constraint handling technique is needed and will be explained\\nhereafter.\\n\\nApart from aerodynamic considerations, the constraints ensure the\\ngeneration of realistic airfoil geometries. From previous studies on\\naeroacoustic optimization (Brian, William, & Anastasios, 1998; Mon-\\nfaredi, Trompoukis, Tsiakas, & Giannakoglou, 2021; Zhou et al., 2015),\\noptimal aeroacoustic geometry generally does not produce improved\\naerodynamic performance. Therefore, to improve the optimization ef-\\nficiency, geometrical considerations are introduced as constraints. Al-\\nthough a thinner airfoil is expected to be more silent, the second\\nconstraint (\\ud835\\udc47 \\u2264 \\ud835\\udc470) limits the thickness of the airfoil to avoid being\\nthicker than the benchmark airfoil. This is required to ensure structural\\ncapabilities/resistance in the final geometry (Ricks et al., 2020). The\\nthird constraint min(\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65) \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc64\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65)) > 0 ; 0 < \\ud835\\udc65 < 1, ensures that\\nthe upper and lower surfaces do not cross each other (e.g., negative\\nvolume shapes). To satisfy this condition, the difference between the\\nupper layer and the lower layer, given the same \\ud835\\udc65 coordinate, should\\nalways be positive. Moreover, the last constraint \\ud835\\udc47Leading \\u2265 \\ud835\\udc47Trailing\\ndemands that the first half of the airfoil is thicker than the second half,\\nto ensure a reasonable aerodynamic configuration. The two thickness\\nparameters are defined as follows:\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc47Leading = max(\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65) \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc64\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65)) ; 0 \\u2264 \\ud835\\udc65 \\u2264 0.5, (4)\\n\\ud835\\udc47Trailing = max(\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65) \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc64\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5f(\\ud835\\udc65)) ; 0.5 < \\ud835\\udc65 \\u2264 1.\\n\\nThe optimization framework is illustrated in Fig. 3. As shown in\\nthe figure, the entire optimization framework involves three main\\ncomponents: (1) design variables (geometrical parameterization); (2)\\naerodynamic and aeroacoustic models; (3) optimizer (optimization al-\\ngorithm and constraint handling). In the current study, the second and\\nthird components are fixed, while two different methods for geometri-\\ncal parameterization have been considered (CST and autoencoder) to\\nshow the potential of machine learning to enhance aeroacoustic shape\\noptimization.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the optimization results depend heavily\\non the problem formulation (Brian et al., 1998). Therefore, if other\\nconstraints are used, the results can be different. In the present work,\\nthe aim is not to propose a new acoustic geometry but rather to show\\nthe capability of autoencoders to enhance the optimization problem.\\nTo complete the optimization algorithm, robust constraint handling\\ntechniques should be considered (Biswas, Suganthan, Mallipeddi, &\\nAmaratunga, 2020; Kuk et al., 2021). Different methods for constraint\\nhandling have been summarized by Kuk et al. (2021), such as discard-\\ning/modifying unfeasible solutions and transforming objective func-\\ntions, etc. Here, we choose to replace unfeasible solutions by randomly\\ngenerating new solutions (Roy & Bhui, 2013), which is beneficial for\\nglobal searches. At each PSO iteration, the particle is first evaluated\\nbased on the constraints, and is discarded if the constraints are not\\nsatisfied. The discarded particle will be replaced by a new particle\\nrandomly generated in the sampling space.\\n\\nFinally, the range of shape parameters, including the CST shape\\nparameters or latent variable of the autoencoder, should be predeter-\\nmined before the optimization starts. For CST parameterization, we\\nhave observed that if the parameter ranges are not properly chosen,\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Variational autoencoder.\\nFOIL can easily stagnate into an infinite loop that hinders the con-\\nergence of the optimization. This is due to the fact that CST does\\not always produce reasonable geometries. Therefore, we chose to\\nerturb the CST parameters of a baseline airfoil (the NACA0012 airfoil),\\nnd the CST parameters are allowed to vary between \\u00b130% of the\\n\\nbaseline parameters. In contrast, since the autoencoder is trained from\\na database of real airfoils, it generates new geometry that follows the\\ntraining database. Therefore, the entire optimization process is easier\\nto converge; thus a wider range of geometrical parameters (latent\\nvariables) can be selected. The optimization process converges when\\nthe predefined number of iterations/generations is reached.\\n\\nDetails on the airfoil shape parameterization, variational autoen-\\ncoders and PSO algorithm will be given in the following subsections.\\n\\n3.2. Airfoil shape parameterization\\n\\nThe review by Li et al. (2022) provides an overview of the tech-\\nniques for airfoil shape parameterization. Our aim in this work is to\\nassess the suitability of variational autoencoders for shape parame-\\nterization when performing optimization. To show the potential of\\nautoencoders, we compare optimization using classic well-established\\nCST parameterization with a variational autoencoder parameterization\\ntechnique.\\n\\n3.2.1. CST parameterization\\nThe Class/Shape function Transformation (CST), proposed by Kul-\\n\\nfan and Bussoletti (2006) in 2006, is a classic and commonly used\\nmethod to represent/parameterize airfoils. CST describes the two-\\ndimensional airfoil (with chord length \\ud835\\udc50) as the product of a class\\nunction \\ud835\\udc36(\\ud835\\udc65\\u2215\\ud835\\udc50) and a shape function \\ud835\\udc46(\\ud835\\udc65\\u2215\\ud835\\udc50), plus a term that considers\\n\\nthe trailing edge thickness (\\ud835\\udee5\\ud835\\udc67\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc52\\u2215\\ud835\\udc50) (Ceze, Hayashi, & Volpe, 2009;\\nSripawadkul, Padulo, & Guenov, 2010):\\n\\ud835\\udc66\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n= \\ud835\\udc36\\n\\n(\\ud835\\udc65\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc46\\n(\\ud835\\udc65\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\n)\\n\\n+ \\ud835\\udc65\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\ud835\\udee5\\ud835\\udc67\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc52\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\n, (5)\\n\\nhere the class function \\ud835\\udc36(\\ud835\\udc65\\u2215\\ud835\\udc50) is given by:\\n(\\ud835\\udc65\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\n)\\n\\n=\\n(\\ud835\\udc65\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\n)\\ud835\\udc411 (\\n\\n1 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc65\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\n)\\ud835\\udc412\\n, 0 \\u2264 \\ud835\\udc65\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\u2264 1.

To generate\\nsmooth and well-defined airfoil configurations, the \\ud835\\udc65 coordinates are\\nspaced using conventional cosine clustering, with 200 coordinates in\\ntotal.\\n\\n3.2.2. Autoencoder-based parameterization\\nAs a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, autoencoders\\n\\nhave been used for many engineering applications, such as uncertainty\\nquantification (Yong & Brintrup, 2022), object detection (Scarpiniti,\\nSarv Ahrabi, Baccarelli, Piazzo, & Momenzadeh, 2022), turbulent flow\\nprediction (Eivazi, Le Clainche, Hoyas, & Vinuesa, 2022), etc. Varia-\\ntional autoencoders have been introduced as a new parameterization\\nmethod, which can enhance the parameterization of airfoils (Yonekura\\n& Suzuki, 2021). VAEs allow for efficient random and guided sampling\\nof novel airfoils from the lower-dimensional latent space of variables,\\navoiding nonphysical shapes, while allowing for a wide variety of\\nshapes.\\n\\nThe proposed VAE has been trained using the UIUC airfoil coordi-\\nnate database (Selig, 1996), using 198 cosine-spaced points per airfoil.\\nMore details of the database can be found in Appendix B. Since the\\n\\ud835\\udc65 spacing for every airfoil is the same, only the vertical coordinate\\n\\ud835\\udc66 is needed to train the network. The architecture (Fig. 4) consists\\nof a symmetrically fully connected multilayer perceptron architecture\\n(MLP) with a variable number of latent features \\ud835\\udc5b between the encoder\\nand decoder parts. The resulting network is capable of generating airfoil\\nshapes by decoding an input set of \\ud835\\udc5b latent variables, as shown in Fig. 4.\\nBy condensing the information from the original airfoil database into\\na lower-dimensional latent space, this allows for faster optimization\\niterations by means of dimensionality reduction (see Fig. 4).\\n\\nLatent variables contain valuable geometric information about the\\nairfoil coordinates. For example, using only \\ud835\\udc5b = 4 latent variable\\ngenerator, we can obtain a large family of airfoils, as shown in Fig. 5.\\nThe loss function \\ue232 , which is the sum of the reconstruction loss and\\nthe Kullback\\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence; see Eq. (8) can be minimized\\nthrough training. The reconstruction loss quantifies the mean square\\nerror (MSE) between the input and output coordinates, while the KL\\ndivergence tries to approximate the latent space to a standard normal\\ndistribution (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In addition, a scaling term \\ud835\\udc58 has\\nbeen included in the KL divergence part of the loss function to reduce\\nthe influence of this term.

Note that the latent variables are the variables for shape\\nptimization and thus using a small number leads to fast optimizations.\\n\\n.4. Optimization algorithm\\n\\nTo efficiently explore the global parameter space, an evolution-\\nry algorithm is considered for optimization. In particular, the par-\\nicle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for optimization.\\nSO is a population-based evolutionary heuristic algorithm proposed\\ny Kennedy and Eberhart (1995). It basically describes a simplified\\nocial model that stems from swarm theory, which mimics the swarm\\nf animal adapting to its surrounding environment. Similar to other\\nvolutionary algorithms (Zhou et al., 2011), PSO does not require\\nny gradient information (gradient-free); therefore, it is very useful\\nor global optimization. So far, PSO has been applied to different\\nerodynamic optimization problems (Venter & Sobieszczanski-Sobieski,\\n004; Wickramasinghe, Carrese, & Li, 2010; Xia, Jiang, & Chen, 2017).\\n\\nIn the PSO algorithm, the particles are initially populated at random\\nositions, each represents a candidate optimization solution. The fitness\\nunction is defined to represent the knowledge gained for each particle,\\nhich defines a criterion that determines the proximity of a particle to\\n\\nhe optimal solution. The basic algorithm of PSO is detailed in Kennedy\\nnd Eberhart (1995), which includes four steps as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize the particle swarm with random positions and random\\n7\\n\\ninitial velocities;\\nFig. 8.

Results and discussion\\n\\nThe initial case to start the optimization procedure is a widely\\ntudied airfoil in the literature, i.e., a NACA 0012 airfoil, in similar\\nonditions as the validation case detailed in Section 2.3, with the\\nifference that it is assumed that the airfoil has a 1 m chord and\\n\\nspan. The far-field observer is located at 1 m from the airfoil trailing\\nedge in the midspan, and the wall pressure spectrum is calculated at\\n\\ud835\\udc65\\u2215\\ud835\\udc50 = 0.99.

(3) includes the sum of OASPL\\nrom three typical AOAs: 0\\u25e6, 2\\u25e6, and 4\\u25e6. For each AOA, the OASPLs are\\nalculated first by applying the A-weighted filter (Doolan, Moreau, &\\nrooks, 2012; Van den Berg, 2004) in the entire frequency spectrum,\\nhen calculating the SPL, using Eq. (2), and finally by integrating in the\\nntire frequency range (which is the output of our acoustic simulator).\\n\\n.1. Classical optimization with CST parameterization\\n\\nIn the first group of optimization, the CST parameterization is\\nsed. A NACA0012 airfoil is used for baseline geometry, which has\\neen widely used for case validation. Six CST parameters have been\\nhosen for each surface, to sufficiently represent the geometry. The CST\\narameters for NACA0012 airfoil are shown in Table 2.\\n\\nNote that because of the symmetrical configuration, the CST pa-\\nameters for the lower surface are the negative counterparts of the\\npper surface. From the baseline parameters, we allow \\u00b130% to change\\nhe CST parameters. In the PSO optimization, the number of itera-\\nions/generation is set to 80, while a group of 40 particles is initialized.\\n\\nFig. 9 shows a typical convergence plot in the optimization process.\\ns the PSO iterations progress, the objective function drops first rapidly\\nnd then converges to the minimal values. From the first to the final\\nteration, about 3 dBA noise is reduced for all AOAs. We run the\\nptimization several times, resulting in very similar final geometries.\\nhree optimized shapes are shown in Fig. 10, which are very similar\\no each other.

The same PSO parameters\\nare used during the optimization. As detailed in Section 3.2.2, the\\nautoencoder generates reasonably good aerodynamic configurations\\nacross a wide range of latent variables. Therefore, the range of all\\nfour latent variables is set to [\\u22123, 3]. All PSO parameters are set the\\nsame as those used for CST-based optimization. In contrast to when\\nusing CST-based optimization, the autoencoder provides multiple final\\ngeometries. Three optimum geometries are depicted in Fig. 11. When\\nchecking the aerodynamic coefficients and the OASPL, see Table 3,\\nwe observe that all geometries have similar values for the objective\\nfunction, but the profiles are now different. In this case, the benchmark\\ngeometry is generated by setting all the latent variables to zero (and\\ndoes not correspond to the NACA0012).\\n\\nThe values of all objective functions, including both CST-based\\n(named as Optimized-1/2/3 (CST)) and autoencoder-based (named\\nas Optimized-1/2/3 (AE)) optimization, are summarized in Table 3.\\nAs shown in the table, both types of parameterization lead to very\\nsimilar objective values, but the autoencoder finds more silent airfoils\\n(in particular, the Optimized-1 (AE)). This indicates that when the\\n9\\n\\noptimized airfoil based on autoencoder (e.g., Optimized-1 (AE)) is used\\nfor wind turbine design, significant reduction of noise can be reached\\n(thus reducing human annoyance levels). Indeed, Table 3 shows the\\noverall noise reduction attained by the optimization framework and\\nthe proposed autoencoder-based parameterization, when considering\\nthree angles of attack. In addition, for each of the angle of attack, the\\naerodynamic and acoustic characteristics is compared in Table 4 (for\\nall AOAs used for optimization, including 0\\u25e6, 2\\u25e6 and 4\\u25e6) and Table 5\\n(for other AOAs including 1\\u25e6 and 3\\u25e6). Since all three results are quite\\nsimilar, only the best result from CST parameterization is included.\\nThese results are plotted in Fig. 12. Although having similar OASPL,\\nthe aerodynamic properties from autoencoder-based optimization are\\nbetter than those from CST-based optimization. Furthermore, the opti-\\nmal airfoil in terms of OASPL (Optimized-1(AE)) reduces around 2.97%\\nfor all angles of attack (the mean value, corresponding to 1.75 dBA),\\ncompared to the baseline NACA0012 airfoil. This indicates that the\\nautoencoder can fully explore the parameter space to generate optimal\\nairfoils. For completeness, the pressure coefficients of all configurations\\nare compared in Fig. 13.\\n\\nTo compare the noise reduction for optimized configurations,\\nFig. 14 shows the far-field noise spectrum. It is clear that, although the\\nintegrated value (OASPL) is used as the objective, the noise across all\\nfrequency ranges is reduced. Compared with the baseline NACA0012,\\nthe optimized airfoils reduce noise at all frequencies and all angles of\\nattack considered. At a small angle of attack (e.g., AOA = 0\\u25e6), optimized\\nairfoils based on autoencoders show lower noise levels at small frequen-\\ncies, compared to optimized airfoils based on CST. On the contrary, the\\noptimized airfoil based on the third autoencoder shows louder noise at\\nhigh frequencies, similar to the baseline airfoil.

Conclusions\\n\\nThis work develops an aeroacoustic airfoil shape optimization\\nframework to reduce the trailing edge noise produced by an attached\\nturbulent boundary layer. We establish the numerical framework by\\n10\\n\\nw\\n\\nusing Amiet\\u2019s theory coupled with the TNO-Blake model for acoustics\\nand the XFOIL solver for aerodynamics. We use PSO in the optimization\\nprocess to ensure an efficient global search. We define the objective\\nfunction of the optimization problem as the OASPL across various\\nAOAs, with aerodynamic and geometric constraints. We introduce\\na variational autoencoder to enhance the shape parameterization of\\nairfoils, to reduce the optimized parameters, and to generate a large\\nfamily of airfoils.\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder finds a large family of optimal ge-\\nometries, whereas the classic CST parameterization converges to very\\nsimilar shapes. Both methods find airfoils with comparable objective\\nfunctions, but the variational autoencoder is superior in better satisfy-\\ning the constraints with improved aerodynamic properties. Compared\\nto the baseline geometry (the NACA0012 airfoil), the autoencoder-\\nbased optimized airfoil reduces by 3% the overall sound pressure\\nlevel (about 1.7 dBA in Overall A-weighted Sound Pressure Level,\\nOASPL), while improving aerodynamic performance. We conclude that\\nthe aeroacoustic optimization framework is a very useful tool for wind\\nturbine airfoil design.\\n\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\n\\nJiaqing Kou: Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Soft-\\nare, Writing \\u2013 original draft, Writing \\u2013 review & editing.

Parameters in Amiet\\u2019s theory\\n\\n.1. Spanwise correlation length\\n\\nA common methodology to obtain the spanwise correlation length\\ns using Corcos\\u2019 model (Corcos, 1964), which depends on an empiri-\\nal constant. This constant can be obtained by fitting the coherence\\netween two sensors located along the span of the airfoil; however,\\nt is usually assumed as a constant value. The spanwise correlation\\nength is related to the distance in the spanwise direction where there\\ns a high level of coherence. It can also be related to the size of\\nhe turbulent structures in the spanwise direction. Theoretically, the\\npanwise correlation length is defined as the integral in the entire span\\nf the coherence between two points in the spanwise direction. It can\\ne calculated from the Corcos\\u2019 model for the coherence between two\\npanwise points as:\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc67\\u2223\\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc43 = \\ud835\\udc4f\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\ud835\\udc48\\ud835\\udc50\\n\\ud835\\udf14\\n\\n(A.1)\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc4f\\ud835\\udc50 is the Corco\\u2019s constant equal to 1.4.\\n\\nA.2. Wall-pressure spectrum\\n\\nThe wall pressure fluctuations in the vicinity of the trailing edge\\nare the near-field noise source of the far-field noise emitted by an\\nairfoil with an attached and turbulent boundary layer. Therefore, it\\nmight be the most important input of Amiet\\u2019s model and critical for\\ngeometry optimization procedures. Therefore, a detailed discussion\\nabout obtaining this quantity is explained in Appendix A.2. They are\\ncaused by velocity fluctuations related to the small structures near the\\nairfoil wall and the larger structures in the outer part of the boundary\\nlayer (Glegg & Devenport, 2017). The smaller structures scale with\\nviscous length (\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udf0f\\u2215\\ud835\\udf08) and are responsible for the high frequency range\\nof the wall pressure spectrum, whereas the larger turbulent structures\\nscale with the boundary layer thickness (\\ud835\\udeff) and are responsible for the\\nlow frequency range of the wall pressure spectrum. The mid-frequency\\nrange scales with both types of structures. Based on this theory, several\\n\\nsemiempirical models have been proposed to model the wall pressure\\n\\nhttp://www.upm.es\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Other model is the one proposed by Blake\\n(2017) which is based on physical analysis by solving the Poisson\\u2019s\\nequation, which governs the relationship between the velocity fluctua-\\ntions across the boundary layer and the wall-pressure fluctuations in the\\nairfoil wall. The model proposed by Blake (2017) was later extended\\nby Parchen (1998) and is now known as the TNO-Blake model. The\\nTNO-Blake model incorporates more physics and takes into account\\nseveral turbulence quantities, and not only integral quantities as in\\nsemiempirical models. For this reason, we retain this model to perform\\nthe optimization procedures presented in this work.\\n\\nThe TNO-Blake model is proposed based on the solution of the\\nPoison equation that results from the divergence of the Navier\\u2013Stokes\\nequation simplified by the continuity equation. The model can be\\napplied to calculate the wall-pressure spectrum close to the trailing\\nedge, however, the turbulence quantities are calculated assuming that\\nthe discontinuity of the trailing edge does not affect the turbulence.\\nFurthermore, the model assumes that the turbulent pressure and ve-\\nlocity field are spatially homogeneous and stationary on time. The\\nwall pressure spectrum can be calculated in the wavenumber\\u2013frequency\\ndomain by applying the Fourier transform in time\\u2013space Fourier trans-\\nform. Therefore, the wall pressure spectrum would depend on the\\nwavenumber in the chordwise direction (\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc65) and spanwise direction\\n\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc67). Integration in \\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc67 can be conducted by introducing the spanwise\\norrelation length that depends on the frequency \\ud835\\udeec\\ud835\\udc67|\\ud835\\udc5d\\ud835\\udc5d3(\\ud835\\udf14). In this re-\\nearch, we follow the TNO-Blake model extension proposed by Stalnov\\nt al. (2016), which also considers the anisotropy of the turbulence by\\nncorporating the stretching parameters.\\n\\nThe single-point wall pressure spectrum can be calculated as fol-\\nows:\\n\\npp(\\ud835\\udf14) =\\n4\\ud835\\udf0b\\ud835\\udf0c2\\n\\n\\ud835\\udeec\\ud835\\udc67\\u2223\\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc43 (\\ud835\\udf14) \\u222b\\n\\n\\ud835\\udeff\\n\\n0\\n\\ud835\\udeec\\ud835\\udc66\\u2223\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc63(\\ud835\\udc66)\\ud835\\udc48\\ud835\\udc50 (\\ud835\\udc66)\\n\\n[\\n\\n\\ud835\\udf15\\ud835\\udc48 (\\ud835\\udc66)\\n\\ud835\\udf15\\ud835\\udc66\\n\\n]2\\n\\n\\u00d7\\n\\ud835\\udc622\\ud835\\udc66(\\ud835\\udc66)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc482\\n\\ud835\\udc50 (\\ud835\\udc66)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udf19\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc63(\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc65, \\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc67 = 0)\\ud835\\udc52\\u22122\\u2223\\ud835\\udf05\\u2223\\ud835\\udc66\\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc66 (A.2)\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udeff is the thickness of the boundary layer, \\ud835\\udeec\\ud835\\udc66\\u2223\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc63(\\ud835\\udc66) is the integral\\nlength scale across the boundary layer in the \\ud835\\udc66 direction, i.e., in the\\ndirection of the boundary layer, perpendicular to the airfoil wall. \\ud835\\udc48\\ud835\\udc50 (\\ud835\\udc66)\\nis the convection velocity across the boundary layer, which is assumed\\nto be between 0.6 and 0.8 the velocity and the stream-wise velocity.\\n\\ud835\\udc48 (\\ud835\\udc66) is the velocity at each position along the boundary layer, \\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc66\\nis the velocity fluctuation in the \\ud835\\udc66 direction. \\ud835\\udf19\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc63 is the turbulence\\nspectrum of the velocity fluctuations in the \\ud835\\udc66-direction. \\u2223 \\ud835\\udf05 \\u2223 is the total\\nwavenumber.

(A.7), where \\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc52 is the wavenumber of\\nthe eddies that contains most of the energy, therefore related to the\\nstreamwise integral length scale.\\n\\n\\ud835\\udf19\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc63 = 4\\n9\\ud835\\udf0b\\n\\n\\ud835\\udefd\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udefd\\ud835\\udc67\\n\\ud835\\udf052\\n\\ud835\\udc52\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\ud835\\udefd\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc65\\u2215\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc52\\n)2 +\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\ud835\\udefd\\ud835\\udc67\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc67\\u2215\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc52\\n)2\\n\\n[\\n\\n1 +\\n(\\n\\n\\ud835\\udefd\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc65\\u2215\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc52\\n)2 +\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\ud835\\udefd\\ud835\\udc67\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc67\\u2215\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc52\\n)2\\n]7\\u22153\\n\\n\\ud835\\udf05\\ud835\\udc52(\\ud835\\udc66) =\\n\\n\\u221a\\n\\n\\ud835\\udf0b \\ud835\\udee4 (5\\u22156)\\n(A.7)\\n\\ud835\\udeec\\ud835\\udc65\\u2223\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc62 \\ud835\\udee4 (1\\u22153)\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Example of an airfoil, from the UIUC database, used for training. The airfoil\\nis discretized with 198 points (shown as dots on the airfoil surface).\\n\\nAppendix B. UIUC database\\n\\nThe training data for the autoencoder has been obtained from the\\nUIUC airfoil database (Selig, 1996). To deal with the disparity in\\nnumber of discretization points for each airfoil in the database, all\\nairfoil shapes have been re-defined by interpolation to 198 cosine-\\nspaced \\ud835\\udc65 points, allowing the use of only the \\ud835\\udc66 coordinate as the input\\nparameter to the autoencoder:\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc56 =\\n1\\n2\\n\\n(\\n\\ncos\\n2\\ud835\\udf0b(\\ud835\\udc56 \\u2212 1)\\n\\n198\\n+ 1\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc56 = 1, 2,\\u2026 , 198. (B.1)\\n\\ndditionally, the leading edge point (\\ud835\\udc65 = \\ud835\\udc66 = 0) has been removed\\nor all airfoils due to it being equal for all shapes and thus not useful\\nor training. Blunt (non-zero thickness) trailing edge airfoils have been\\nodified into sharp trailing edge airfoils by finding the intersection\\n13\\nbetween the upper and lower surfaces and extending them to the end\\npoint.\\n\\nFinally, 1427 airfoil samples defined by 198 \\ud835\\udc66-coordinate points\\neach have been used for training. As detailed in Table B.6, this database\\nencompasses a broad range of non-dimensional airfoil thicknesses \\ud835\\udc61\\u2215\\ud835\\udc50,\\ndefined as the maximum vertical distance between upper and lower\\nsurfaces for a given airfoil. Two airfoils with maximum and minimum\\nthicknesses in the database are shown in Fig. B.15. Furthermore, the\\nsurface discretization of the airfoil (i.e., distribution of 198 points on\\nthe surface) is shown in Fig. B.16. Note that all airfoils share the same\\ncoordinates in the \\ud835\\udc65-direction.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAlfredsson, P. H., \\u00d6rl\\u00fc, R., & Segalini, A. (2011).

To this end, we present a framework for airfoil shape optimization\\nto reduce the trailing edge noise for the design of wind turbine blades. Far-field noise is evaluated using\\nAmiet’s theory coupled with the TNO-Blake model to calculate the wall pressure spectrum and fast turn-around\\nXFOIL simulations to evaluate the boundary layer parameters. The computational framework is first validated\\nusing a NACA0012 airfoil at 0◦ angle of attack. Particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimized\\nairfoil configuration. The multi-objective optimization minimizes the A-weighted overall sound pressure level\\nat various angles of attack, while ensuring enough lift and minimum drag. Furthermore, traditional shape\\noptimization techniques show difficulties to converge to the optimum, when too many shape parameters are\\nincluded in the optimization. For this reason, we compare classic parameterization methods to define the\\nairfoil geometry (i.e., CST) to a machine learning method (i.e., a variational autoencoder). We observe that\\nvariational autoencoders can represent a wide variety of geometries, with only four encoded variables, leading\\nto efficient optimizations, which result in improved optimal shapes. When compared to the baseline geometry, a\\nNACA0012, the autoencoder-based optimized airfoil reduces by 3% (1.75 dBA) the overall sound pressure level\\n(with decreased noise across the entire frequency range), while maintaining favorable aerodynamic properties\\nin terms of lift and drag.\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nWind turbine noise has typically been one of the main drawbacks of\\nthe wide deployment and acceptance of wind devices for the generation\\nof clean energy. The interest in controlling turbine acoustics is increas-\\ning since turbines are now being integrated in urban environments,\\nwhere noise nuisances can be of great concern (Hubbard & Shepherd,\\n2009; Rogers, Manwell, & Wright, 2006). Wind turbine aeroacoustics is\\na complex phenomenon that includes several sources of noise. The most\\ncritical noise sources of a typical wind turbine are: (1) steady loading,\\nwhich relates to the distribution of forces along the blade leading to\\nbroadband noise; (2) unsteady loading caused by the incoming sheared\\nand turbulent atmospheric flow, associated with low frequency noise;\\nand (3) airfoil self-noise, which encompasses various high frequency\\nphenomena that relate to the boundary layer and eddies generated as\\nthe air passes the blades.\\n\\nAirfoil self-noise (Brooks, Pope, & Marcolini, 1989) is the minimum\\namount of noise produced by an aerodynamic surface and is the main\\n\\n∗ Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: jiaqing.kou@alumnos.upm.es (J.

It is caused by the interaction of the turbulent boundary\\nlayer with the blade surface close to the trailing edge, when the\\nhydrodynamic pressure fluctuations originated in the airfoil surface\\nare scattered to the far field as noise, due to the sudden change of\\nimpedance in the blade trailing edge discontinuity (Stalnov, Chaitanya,\\n& Joseph, 2016). To generate quiet wind turbines, it is necessary\\nto select airfoils that minimize noise generation in operational con-\\nditions (e.g. attached flow). Typical turbine airfoils were designed\\nto be insensitive to roughness, by promoting the transition near the\\nleading edge (Bertagnolio, Sørensen, Johansen, & Fuglsang, 2001),\\nwhile noise generation was often neglected. However, social pressure\\nto minimize wind farm noise leads to considering acoustics during\\nthe design phase of new airfoils. The SIROCO project (Humpf, Ferrer,\\n& Munduate, 2007; Lutz, Herrig, Würz, Kamruzzaman, & Krämer,\\n2007; Schepers et al., 2007) incorporated aeroacoustic predictions for\\nshape optimization design.

Kou et al.\\n\\nt\\nd\\ns\\na\\ns\\ni\\n\\npredict airfoil trailing edge far-field noise, by combining XFOIL, a\\nfinite-difference code, and a modified TNO-TPD model. The method\\nhas been used to design new, less-noisy airfoils without loss in aero-\\ndynamic performance. Similarly, Hao, Zhang, Liu, and Liu (2008)\\nintroduced aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimization of the wind\\nturbine blade using a genetic algorithm. Lee, Lee, Ryi, and Choi (2013)\\noptimized the airfoils of the wind turbine based on genetic algorithms,\\nto reduce airfoil self-noise, and validated the results by wind tunnel\\nexperiment. Rodrigues and Marta (2014) performed multi-objective op-\\ntimization to design wind turbine blades, where an increase in annual\\nenergy production of 15% was achieved with a reduction in noise levels\\nof 9.8%. Zhou et al. (2015) proposed a discrete adjoint framework\\nfor unsteady aerodynamic aeroacoustic optimization. More recently,\\nVolkmer and Carolus (2018) performed aeroacoustic airfoil shape opti-\\nmization based on semi-empirical aeroacoustic models. There, XFOIL\\nis combined with Amiet’s model and evolutionary optimization to\\ndesign airfoils with less noise while maintaining the required lift. Ricks,\\nTsirikoglou, Contino, and Ghorbaniasl (2020) proposed multi-objective\\naerodynamic-aeroacoustic shape optimization of airfoils based on a\\nReynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver with a state-of-the-art wall\\npressure spectrum model and Amiet’s model for trailing edge noise. Bu,\\nSong, Han, Zhang, and Zhang (2020) developed the framework for\\naerodynamic/aeroacoustic variable-fidelity optimization of helicopter\\nrotor based on hierarchical Kriging model. These works show the effi-\\nciency of using Amiet’s theory and XFOIL for aeroacoustic optimization,\\nwhereas recent machine learning strategies (e.g., autoencoders) have\\nnot been considered.\\n\\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are permeating in all fields of\\nfluid dynamics (Brunton & Kutz, 2019; Garnier et al., 2021; Kou\\n& Zhang, 2021; leClainche et al., 2022; Vinuesa & Brunton, 2022;\\nYondo, Andrés, & Valero, 2018) and aerodynamic optimization; see\\nthe recent review by Li, Du, and Martins (2022). ML can be used as\\na surrogate model to replace the expensive flow simulations (Sun &\\nWang, 2019). For example, Boutemedjet, Samardžić, Rebhi, Rajić, and\\nMouada (2019) proposed the aerodynamic design procedure of a mini\\nunmanned aerial vehicle involving genetic algorithms and artificial\\nneural networks for wing preliminary computation. Liao, Song, Du, and\\nZhao (2021) introduced multi-fidelity convolutional neural networks as\\na surrogate model for aerodynamic optimization. Moreover, Yan, Zhu,\\nKuang, and Wang (2019) developed an optimizer based on reinforce-\\nment learning and transfer learning, to enhance aerodynamic shape\\noptimization.\\n\\nIn particular, unsupervised ML techniques for dimensionality reduc-\\ntion enable the treatment of problems with a large number of variables\\nby coding the information into a reduced number of parameters (i.e., la-\\ntent variables). Neural networks are ideal for representing nonlinear\\nfunctions and can thus encode information very efficiently in very\\nfew latent variables. Autoencoders (AEs) are artificial neural networks\\nthat can reduce the dataset information (encoding), but that can also\\nreconstruct (decode) the original data, minimizing the reconstruction\\nerror. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) improve the behavior of classic\\nautoencoders by enforcing latent variables to follow smooth statistical\\ndistributions (typically normal distributions) (Kingma & Welling, 2013;\\nZhao, Song, & Ermon, 2017). By doing so, it is possible to avoid discon-\\ntinuities in the latent variables, which helps to reconstruct the original\\ndatabase. Another advantage of requiring smooth latent variables is\\nthat they can be used for optimization.\\n\\nVAEs have not been widely adopted for optimization. In fact, to\\nthe authors’ knowledge, only Rios et al. (2021) have used VAEs\\nfor car optimization. They showed the superiority of this technique\\nin incorporating local geometric features, when compared to modal\\ntechniques (e.g., principal component analysis). Additionally, Yonekura\\nand Suzuki (2021) have shown the advantages of VAEs to represent\\nairfoils using latent variables, but did not perform optimizations.\\n\\nEncouraged by the previous work, in this work we propose using\\nVAEs to enhance the aeroacoustic optimization of wind turbine air-\\n2\\n\\nfoils. We target the airfoil self-noise using Amiet’s theory and develop\\nan optimization framework that targets improved aerodynamics with\\nminimum noise in the design. We include VAEs for the parameteri-\\nzation of the airfoil geometry and compare this technique with the\\nCST method (Kulfan & Bussoletti, 2006) to parameterize the airfoil\\ngeometry. Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed framework, including the\\ninputs and outputs, as well as the basic workflow of the optimization\\nframework. As will be shown in the results, VAEs show superiority and\\nenhanced robustness over CST. The main contributions of this work\\nare: (1) We develop a framework for aeroacoustic shape optimization;\\n(2) We incorporate autoencoders to enhance shape parameterization.\\nThe results show the superior capabilities of the aeroacoustic shape\\noptimization framework when enhanced by autoencoders.\\n\\nThe remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in-\\ntroduces the far-field noise prediction framework, including the aeroa-\\ncoustic and aerodynamic models, as well as the validation of the\\nframework. The optimization framework is introduced in Section 3,\\nwhere the shape parameterization including CST and VAEs, the op-\\ntimization algorithm, and the problem formulation are detailed. The\\noptimization results are summarized in Section 4. Conclusions are\\nprovided in Section 5.\\n\\n2. Far-field noise prediction\\n\\nThis section introduces the computational models used in the\\npresent study, including the aerodynamic and acoustic models. Amiet’s\\ntheory (Amiet, 1976) is adopted here for the trailing edge noise pre-\\ndiction. The theory calculates the far-field acoustic pressure spectrum\\nusing the wall pressure wavenumber–frequency spectral density in the\\nvicinity of the trailing edge as input. This theory assumes a large span,\\na stationary observer and airfoil, and a uniform flow, and that the\\nboundary layer turbulence is convecting over the trailing edge as a\\nfrozen pattern, i.e., the turbulence is not affected by the discontinuity\\nof the trailing edge.\\n\\n2.1. The acoustic model\\n\\nEq. (1) presents the far-field power spectral density of an airfoil of\\nchord c and span b for an observer perpendicular to the trailing edge\\nat midspan (z0 = 0) (Stalnov et al., 2016):\\n\\n𝑆𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑜, 𝑦𝑜, 𝑧𝑜 = 0, 𝜔) =\\n(\\n\\n𝜔𝑐𝑦𝑜\\n4𝜋𝑐𝑜𝜎2\\n\\n)\\n\\n𝑏\\n2\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\nℒ (𝜅𝑥, 𝜅𝑧 = 0, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑈∞, 𝑈𝑐 )\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n2\\n\\n× 𝛬𝑧|𝑃𝑃𝛱pp(𝜔).

The reference system adopts 𝑥 in the streamwise\\nirection, 𝑦 in the direction perpendicular to the wall and 𝑧 in the\\npanwise direction, with 𝑥 = 𝑦 = 𝑧 = 0 at the trailing edge of the\\nirfoil in the mid-span. 𝑐𝑜 is the speed of sound, 𝜅𝑥 and 𝜅𝑧 are the\\npatial wavenumber in the 𝑥 and 𝑧 directions, and 𝑈𝑐 = 0.6 × 𝑈∞\\ns the mean convection velocity. ℒ is the airfoil response function\\n\\nproposed by Amiet (1976) which is the transfer between hydrodynamic\\nwall pressure fluctuations caused by the turbulent boundary layer and\\nacoustic waves in the far field. Amiet considered a flat plate, therefore,\\nℒ is constant among the different airfoils. The implementation of ℒ\\nfollowed in this work, was proposed by Roger and Moreau (2005)\\nand considers the backscattering effect of the leading edge. 𝛬𝑧|𝑃𝑃 is\\nthe spanwise correlation length, which is related to the size of the\\nvortices in the spanwise direction. Finally, 𝛱pp(𝜔) is the wall pressure\\nspectrum in the vicinity of the trailing edge and is comparable to the\\nmeasurements of a sensor located on the airfoil surface. The wall-\\npressure spectrum is the only quantity that is different for each airfoil\\nfacing the same inflow conditions. The wall-pressure spectrum is calcu-\\nlated using the TNO-Blake model, explained in detail in Appendix A.2.\\nAdditional details on how to compute the various parameters in Eq.

Aerodynamic simulation based on XFOIL\\n\\nNumerical simulations using XFOIL (Drela, 1989) are conducted to\\nobtain the boundary layer characteristics, see Appendix A.3, for each\\ncandidate airfoil during the optimization procedure. XFOIL is a viscous-\\ninviscid iterative software code that does not require any prior mesh\\npreparation. The inviscid pressure distribution is modeled using a linear\\nvortex strength distribution. Viscous effects and the development of\\nthe laminar-turbulent boundary layer are modeled using linear stability\\n(i.e., the e method) and integral boundary layer theory. The XFOIL\\noutputs are used to calculate the wall pressure spectrum, which, in turn,\\nis used to predict the far-field noise produced by the airfoil.\\n\\nIn all the cases included in this work, we fix the boundary layer\\ntransition near the leading edge in both pressure and suction sides,\\nto mimic the insensitivity to roughness that is commonly sought in\\nwind turbine airfoils. The number of panel nodes is set to 160 and the\\nnumber of iterations to 1000.\\n\\n2.3. Methodology validation: NACA0012 airfoil\\n\\nTo validate the trailing edge noise prediction methodology, a widely\\nstudied airfoil in the literature, i.e., a NACA 0012 airfoil is used,\\ncomparing our results with those obtained in the literature. The airfoil\\nis assumed to have a 0.4 m chord and a 1 m span. The far-field observer\\nis located at 1 m from the airfoil trailing edge at mid-span, i.e., 𝑥 = 0,\\n𝑦 = 1 m, and 𝑧 = 0. The wall pressure spectrum is calculated at\\n𝑥∕𝑐 = 0.99. The boundary layer transition is fixed at 𝑥∕𝑐 = 0.06\\non both sides. The angle of attack is fixed at 0◦. The inflow velocity\\nis assumed to be 56 m∕s, which corresponds to a Reynolds number of\\n1.5 × 106 and a Mach number of 0.16. The frequency resolution is 1 Hz\\nand the far-field noise 𝑆pp is calculated from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. Sound\\npressure level (SPL) is calculated at the observer location by\\n\\n𝑆𝑃𝐿 = 20 log10\\n𝑝\\n\\n𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n, (2)\\n\\nwhere 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the acoustic pressure reference, that for air, is 20 μPa, and\\n𝑝 is the far field pressure, obtained from the sum of the power spectral\\ndensity (𝑆𝑝𝑝 from Eq. (1)) from both, pressure and suction side, and\\nmultiplied by the frequency resolution.\\n\\nComparisons have been conducted with experimental results re-\\nported in Herr et al. (2012) (results have been scaled to match the\\npresented conditions) and with noise prediction using Amiet’s the-\\nory coupled with the semi-empirical model proposed by Kamruzza-\\nman, Bekiropoulos, Lutz, Würz, and Krämer (2015) and RANS sim-\\nulations (Küçükosman et al., 2018). Fig. 2 shows the far-field noise\\nspectrum in 1/3 octave for the predicted far-field using the methodol-\\nogy presented in this paper and in the literature. Additionally, Table 1\\nshows the integrated pressure level of the spectrum for the same cases,\\nbetween a frequency range of 1000 to 6300 Hz, i.e., the frequency\\nrange where all data is available. The results suggest that the ap-\\nplied methodology, i.e., XFOIL coupled with the TNO-Blake model and\\nAmiet’s theory, is appropriate to predict trailing edge noise and agrees\\n3\\n\\nFig. 2.

The validation indicates that the proposed method provides re-\\nsults with comparable accuracy to more costly flow solvers, while being\\nfast enough to be used for optimization, where multiple evaluations of\\nthe acoustic performance are needed for different airfoils.\\n\\n3. Optimization framework\\n\\nThe optimization framework is introduced, including the parameter-\\nization of the shape, the optimization algorithm, and the formulation\\nof the problem (objective function and constraints). As a key ingredient\\nto enhance aeroacoustic shape optimization, a variational autoencoder\\nis introduced to parameterize the airfoil surfaces. Fig. 3 shows the\\nframework for aeroacoustic shape optimization. As shown in the figure,\\nthree main steps are needed:\\n\\nStep 1: Get design variables (shape parameterization) and recon-\\nstruct the airfoil geometry (based on CST parameters, or latent variables\\nand decoder part of autoencoders). The design variables are initialized\\nat the beginning of the optimization and are further updated based on\\nthe optimization algorithm.\\n\\nStep 2: Given each airfoil shape in Step 1, evaluate the correspond-\\ning aerodynamic and acoustic properties, through XFoil and Amiet’s\\ntheory, respectively.\\n\\nStep 3: Check if the aerodynamic properties satisfy the constraint,\\nand calculate the fitness function from the acoustic property (for each\\nparticle). Moreover, update the particle (i.e., design variables for the\\nevaluation in the next generation) based on the PSO algorithm. If\\nthe optimization does not converge, repeat these steps for the next\\ngeneration of the PSO algorithm.\\n\\nMore details about the optimization framework will be given in the\\nnext subsection.\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Aeroacoustic shape optimization framework.\\n\\n3.1. Problem formulation: optimization objective and constraints\\n\\nIn this study, we are interested in geometric optimization for noise\\nminimization. Therefore, the Overall A-weighted Sound Pressure Level\\n(OASPL) is selected as the objective function. The OASPL is used to\\nweight the spectrum energy in the frequency domain with the sensi-\\ntivity of human hearing, resulting in optimized geometries suitable for\\nwind turbines located near urban areas. Since the optimized airfoil is\\nexpected to work on multiple operating conditions, the multi-objective\\noptimization is needed. Therefore, we formulated this problem by\\nconsidering the overall OASPL for various angles of attack (AOAs)\\nas the objective function. Meanwhile, to maintain reasonable aero-\\ndynamic performance and reasonable geometries, several constraints\\nshould be satisfied. Therefore, the following objective and constraints\\nare selected:\\n\\nmin\\n𝑏∕𝑧\\n\\n𝑠\\n∑\\n\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑂𝐴𝑆𝑃𝐿(𝐴𝑂𝐴𝑖), (3)\\n\\nsubject to 𝐶𝑙,𝑖 ≥ 𝐶𝑙0,𝑖 ; 𝐶𝑑,𝑖 ≤ 𝐶𝑑0,𝑖,\\n\\n𝑇 ≤ 𝑇0,\\n\\nmin(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) > 0 ; 0 < 𝑥 < 1,\\n\\n𝑇Leading ≥ 𝑇Trailing.\\n\\nwhere 𝑏 and 𝑧 refer to the CST parameters or the latent variable\\nof the autoencoder. 𝑇 refers to the maximal thickness of the airfoil.\\nThe sum of OASPL at the 𝑠 angle of attack is used to evaluate the\\nobjective function. The parameter with subscript 0 refers to the baseline\\ngeometry, where the NACA0012 airfoil is chosen for all angles of attack.\\nTo maintain reasonable aerodynamic performance, we do not expect\\na drop in lift or an increase in drag, compared to the baseline case.\\n4\\n\\nTherefore, the first group of constraints is imposed: 𝐶𝑙,𝑖 ≥ 𝐶𝑙0,𝑖, 𝐶𝑑,𝑖 ≤\\n𝐶𝑑0,𝑖, where 𝐶𝑙0 and 𝐶𝑑0 refer to the lift and drag coefficients of the\\nbaseline geometry, respectively. The constraint applies to all AOAs\\nconsidered during optimization. All of them are hard constraints that\\nmust be satisfied during the optimization process; therefore, a suit-\\nable constraint handling technique is needed and will be explained\\nhereafter.\\n\\nApart from aerodynamic considerations, the constraints ensure the\\ngeneration of realistic airfoil geometries. From previous studies on\\naeroacoustic optimization (Brian, William, & Anastasios, 1998; Mon-\\nfaredi, Trompoukis, Tsiakas, & Giannakoglou, 2021; Zhou et al., 2015),\\noptimal aeroacoustic geometry generally does not produce improved\\naerodynamic performance. Therefore, to improve the optimization ef-\\nficiency, geometrical considerations are introduced as constraints. Al-\\nthough a thinner airfoil is expected to be more silent, the second\\nconstraint (𝑇 ≤ 𝑇0) limits the thickness of the airfoil to avoid being\\nthicker than the benchmark airfoil. This is required to ensure structural\\ncapabilities/resistance in the final geometry (Ricks et al., 2020). The\\nthird constraint min(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) > 0 ; 0 < 𝑥 < 1, ensures that\\nthe upper and lower surfaces do not cross each other (e.g., negative\\nvolume shapes). To satisfy this condition, the difference between the\\nupper layer and the lower layer, given the same 𝑥 coordinate, should\\nalways be positive. Moreover, the last constraint 𝑇Leading ≥ 𝑇Trailing\\ndemands that the first half of the airfoil is thicker than the second half,\\nto ensure a reasonable aerodynamic configuration. The two thickness\\nparameters are defined as follows:\\n\\n𝑇Leading = max(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) ; 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 0.5, (4)\\n𝑇Trailing = max(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) ; 0.5 < 𝑥 ≤ 1.\\n\\nThe optimization framework is illustrated in Fig. 3. As shown in\\nthe figure, the entire optimization framework involves three main\\ncomponents: (1) design variables (geometrical parameterization); (2)\\naerodynamic and aeroacoustic models; (3) optimizer (optimization al-\\ngorithm and constraint handling). In the current study, the second and\\nthird components are fixed, while two different methods for geometri-\\ncal parameterization have been considered (CST and autoencoder) to\\nshow the potential of machine learning to enhance aeroacoustic shape\\noptimization.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the optimization results depend heavily\\non the problem formulation (Brian et al., 1998). Therefore, if other\\nconstraints are used, the results can be different. In the present work,\\nthe aim is not to propose a new acoustic geometry but rather to show\\nthe capability of autoencoders to enhance the optimization problem.\\nTo complete the optimization algorithm, robust constraint handling\\ntechniques should be considered (Biswas, Suganthan, Mallipeddi, &\\nAmaratunga, 2020; Kuk et al., 2021). Different methods for constraint\\nhandling have been summarized by Kuk et al. (2021), such as discard-\\ning/modifying unfeasible solutions and transforming objective func-\\ntions, etc. Here, we choose to replace unfeasible solutions by randomly\\ngenerating new solutions (Roy & Bhui, 2013), which is beneficial for\\nglobal searches. At each PSO iteration, the particle is first evaluated\\nbased on the constraints, and is discarded if the constraints are not\\nsatisfied. The discarded particle will be replaced by a new particle\\nrandomly generated in the sampling space.\\n\\nFinally, the range of shape parameters, including the CST shape\\nparameters or latent variable of the autoencoder, should be predeter-\\nmined before the optimization starts. For CST parameterization, we\\nhave observed that if the parameter ranges are not properly chosen,\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Variational autoencoder.\\nFOIL can easily stagnate into an infinite loop that hinders the con-\\nergence of the optimization. This is due to the fact that CST does\\not always produce reasonable geometries. Therefore, we chose to\\nerturb the CST parameters of a baseline airfoil (the NACA0012 airfoil),\\nnd the CST parameters are allowed to vary between ±30% of the\\n\\nbaseline parameters. In contrast, since the autoencoder is trained from\\na database of real airfoils, it generates new geometry that follows the\\ntraining database. Therefore, the entire optimization process is easier\\nto converge; thus a wider range of geometrical parameters (latent\\nvariables) can be selected. The optimization process converges when\\nthe predefined number of iterations/generations is reached.\\n\\nDetails on the airfoil shape parameterization, variational autoen-\\ncoders and PSO algorithm will be given in the following subsections.\\n\\n3.2. Airfoil shape parameterization\\n\\nThe review by Li et al. (2022) provides an overview of the tech-\\nniques for airfoil shape parameterization. Our aim in this work is to\\nassess the suitability of variational autoencoders for shape parame-\\nterization when performing optimization. To show the potential of\\nautoencoders, we compare optimization using classic well-established\\nCST parameterization with a variational autoencoder parameterization\\ntechnique.\\n\\n3.2.1. CST parameterization\\nThe Class/Shape function Transformation (CST), proposed by Kul-\\n\\nfan and Bussoletti (2006) in 2006, is a classic and commonly used\\nmethod to represent/parameterize airfoils. CST describes the two-\\ndimensional airfoil (with chord length 𝑐) as the product of a class\\nunction 𝐶(𝑥∕𝑐) and a shape function 𝑆(𝑥∕𝑐), plus a term that considers\\n\\nthe trailing edge thickness (𝛥𝑧𝑡𝑒∕𝑐) (Ceze, Hayashi, & Volpe, 2009;\\nSripawadkul, Padulo, & Guenov, 2010):\\n𝑦\\n𝑐\\n= 𝐶\\n\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)\\n\\n𝑆\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)\\n\\n+ 𝑥\\n𝑐\\n𝛥𝑧𝑡𝑒\\n𝑐\\n\\n, (5)\\n\\nhere the class function 𝐶(𝑥∕𝑐) is given by:\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)\\n\\n=\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)𝑁1 (\\n\\n1 − 𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)𝑁2\\n, 0 ≤ 𝑥\\n\\n𝑐\\n≤ 1. (6)\\n\\nThe exponents 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 are set to 0.5 and 1.0 for a general airfoil\\nshape. This ensures a round leading edge (\\n\\n√\\n\\n𝑥∕𝑐) and a sharp trailing\\ndge (1 − 𝑥). To generate arbitrary airfoils, a Bernstein polynomial is\\nsed for the shape function:\\n(𝑥) =\\n\\n𝑛\\n∑\\n\\n[\\n\\n𝑏𝑖 ⋅𝐾𝑖,𝑛 ⋅\\n(𝑥)𝑖\\n\\n⋅\\n(\\n\\n1 − 𝑥)𝑛−𝑖\\n]\\n\\n, 𝐾𝑖,𝑛 =\\n𝑛! , (7)\\n5\\n\\n𝑐 𝑖=0 𝑐 𝑐 𝑖!(𝑛 − 𝑖)!\\nwhere 𝑏𝑖 is the design parameter of the CST method. To generate\\nsmooth and well-defined airfoil configurations, the 𝑥 coordinates are\\nspaced using conventional cosine clustering, with 200 coordinates in\\ntotal.\\n\\n3.2.2. Autoencoder-based parameterization\\nAs a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, autoencoders\\n\\nhave been used for many engineering applications, such as uncertainty\\nquantification (Yong & Brintrup, 2022), object detection (Scarpiniti,\\nSarv Ahrabi, Baccarelli, Piazzo, & Momenzadeh, 2022), turbulent flow\\nprediction (Eivazi, Le Clainche, Hoyas, & Vinuesa, 2022), etc. Varia-\\ntional autoencoders have been introduced as a new parameterization\\nmethod, which can enhance the parameterization of airfoils (Yonekura\\n& Suzuki, 2021). VAEs allow for efficient random and guided sampling\\nof novel airfoils from the lower-dimensional latent space of variables,\\navoiding nonphysical shapes, while allowing for a wide variety of\\nshapes.\\n\\nThe proposed VAE has been trained using the UIUC airfoil coordi-\\nnate database (Selig, 1996), using 198 cosine-spaced points per airfoil.\\nMore details of the database can be found in Appendix B. Since the\\n𝑥 spacing for every airfoil is the same, only the vertical coordinate\\n𝑦 is needed to train the network. The architecture (Fig. 4) consists\\nof a symmetrically fully connected multilayer perceptron architecture\\n(MLP) with a variable number of latent features 𝑛 between the encoder\\nand decoder parts. The resulting network is capable of generating airfoil\\nshapes by decoding an input set of 𝑛 latent variables, as shown in Fig. 4.\\nBy condensing the information from the original airfoil database into\\na lower-dimensional latent space, this allows for faster optimization\\niterations by means of dimensionality reduction (see Fig. 4).\\n\\nLatent variables contain valuable geometric information about the\\nairfoil coordinates. For example, using only 𝑛 = 4 latent variable\\ngenerator, we can obtain a large family of airfoils, as shown in Fig. 5.\\nThe loss function \\ue232 , which is the sum of the reconstruction loss and\\nthe Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence; see Eq. (8) can be minimized\\nthrough training. The reconstruction loss quantifies the mean square\\nerror (MSE) between the input and output coordinates, while the KL\\ndivergence tries to approximate the latent space to a standard normal\\ndistribution (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In addition, a scaling term 𝑘 has\\nbeen included in the KL divergence part of the loss function to reduce\\nthe influence of this term. Through Experimenting, we find an optimal\\nvalue of 𝑘 = 5 ⋅ 10−6, see Section 3.3.\\n\\n\\ue232 = \\ue232𝑟𝑒𝑐 + 𝑘 ⋅𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑝 ∥ 𝑞)\\n\\n\\ue232𝑟𝑒𝑐 =\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n𝒚𝑜𝑢𝑡2 − 𝒚𝑖𝑛2\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑝 ∥ 𝑞) = −1\\n𝑛\\n∑\\n\\n(\\n\\n1 + log(𝜎2𝑖 ) − 𝜇2\\n𝑖 − 𝜎2𝑖\\n\\n)\\n\\n.\\n\\n(8)\\n2 𝑖=1\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Evaluation metric\\nThe metric used to evaluate the performance of the model is the\\n\\nFréchet distance (FD), frequently used to assess image generation mod-\\nels, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Heusel, Ram-\\nsauer, Unterthiner, Nessler, & Hochreiter, 2017). In the variational\\nautoencoder, it is used to quantify the distance between the generated\\nairfoil distribution, with normal distribution (𝜇𝟏, 𝜎𝟏) and the original\\nirfoil distribution from the UIUC database, with normal distribution\\n𝜇𝟐, 𝜎𝟐):\\n\\n𝐷 = 𝑑2 = ‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n𝜇𝟏 − 𝜇𝟐‖‖\\n2 + 𝑇 𝑟\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝜎𝟏 + 𝜎𝟐 − 2\\n√\\n\\n𝜎𝟏 ⋅ 𝜎𝟐\\n)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nhere 𝜇𝐢 is the mean vector and 𝜎𝐢 is the covariance matrix for each\\nistribution.

This results in a stagnation\\nn both the FD and the reconstruction error for large 𝑘.

This architecture is retained\\nhroughout this work, which is illustrated in Fig. 7.\\n\\n.3.4. Number of latent variables\\nTo determine the final autoencoder, we study the effect of in-\\n\\nreasing the number of latent variables in the autoencoder, fixing\\nhe three-layer network with [466, 167, 234] neurons in each layer\\nand optimized in the previous section). We vary the number of latent\\nariables by changing the width of the middle layer of the optimal\\nutoencoder network with the architecture described in the previous\\nubsection.\\n\\nFig. 8 shows the Fréchet distance variations when changing the\\number of latent variables. We observe a sharp increase in the Fréchet\\nistance for 𝑛 < 4 and little improvement for 𝑛 > 4. We keep 𝑛 = 4 latent\\nariables. Note that the latent variables are the variables for shape\\nptimization and thus using a small number leads to fast optimizations.\\n\\n.4. Optimization algorithm\\n\\nTo efficiently explore the global parameter space, an evolution-\\nry algorithm is considered for optimization. In particular, the par-\\nicle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for optimization.\\nSO is a population-based evolutionary heuristic algorithm proposed\\ny Kennedy and Eberhart (1995). It basically describes a simplified\\nocial model that stems from swarm theory, which mimics the swarm\\nf animal adapting to its surrounding environment. Similar to other\\nvolutionary algorithms (Zhou et al., 2011), PSO does not require\\nny gradient information (gradient-free); therefore, it is very useful\\nor global optimization. So far, PSO has been applied to different\\nerodynamic optimization problems (Venter & Sobieszczanski-Sobieski,\\n004; Wickramasinghe, Carrese, & Li, 2010; Xia, Jiang, & Chen, 2017).\\n\\nIn the PSO algorithm, the particles are initially populated at random\\nositions, each represents a candidate optimization solution. The fitness\\nunction is defined to represent the knowledge gained for each particle,\\nhich defines a criterion that determines the proximity of a particle to\\n\\nhe optimal solution. The basic algorithm of PSO is detailed in Kennedy\\nnd Eberhart (1995), which includes four steps as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize the particle swarm with random positions and random\\n7\\n\\ninitial velocities;\\nFig. 8. Fréchet distance against number of latent variables for a three-layer network\\nwith [466, 167, 234] neurons in each layer.\\n\\n2.

Update the position of each particle based on the updated veloc-\\nity and the previous position;\\n\\n4. Go to Step 2 and repeat until convergence.\\n\\nAt each iteration, the position and velocity of the 𝑖th particle are\\nupdated as follows:\\n\\n𝑽 𝑔+1\\n𝑖 = 𝜔(𝑔) × 𝑽 𝑔\\n\\n𝑖 + 𝑐1𝑟1 × (𝑷𝒃𝒆𝒔𝒕𝑔𝑖 −𝑿𝑔\\n𝑖 ) + 𝑐2𝑟2 × (𝑮𝒃𝒆𝒔𝒕𝑔𝑖 −𝑿𝑔\\n\\n𝑖 ), (10)\\n\\n𝑿𝑔+1\\n𝑖 = 𝑿𝑔\\n\\n𝑖 + 𝑽 𝑔+1\\n𝑖 , (11)\\n\\n(𝑔 + 1) = 𝜔2 − (𝜔2 − 𝜔1) × 𝑔∕𝐺, (12)\\n\\nhere 𝑔 is the index of the present generation (iteration), 𝐺 is the\\naximum generation (iteration) number.

The far-field observer is located at 1 m from the airfoil trailing\\nedge in the midspan, and the wall pressure spectrum is calculated at\\n𝑥∕𝑐 = 0.99. The boundary layer transition is fixed at 𝑥∕𝑐 = 0.06\\nn both sides.

Since\\nhe optimized airfoil is expected to operate under multiple operating\\nonditions, the objective function in Eq. (3) includes the sum of OASPL\\nrom three typical AOAs: 0◦, 2◦, and 4◦. For each AOA, the OASPLs are\\nalculated first by applying the A-weighted filter (Doolan, Moreau, &\\nrooks, 2012; Van den Berg, 2004) in the entire frequency spectrum,\\nhen calculating the SPL, using Eq. (2), and finally by integrating in the\\nntire frequency range (which is the output of our acoustic simulator).\\n\\n.1. Classical optimization with CST parameterization\\n\\nIn the first group of optimization, the CST parameterization is\\nsed. A NACA0012 airfoil is used for baseline geometry, which has\\neen widely used for case validation. Six CST parameters have been\\nhosen for each surface, to sufficiently represent the geometry. The CST\\narameters for NACA0012 airfoil are shown in Table 2.\\n\\nNote that because of the symmetrical configuration, the CST pa-\\nameters for the lower surface are the negative counterparts of the\\npper surface. From the baseline parameters, we allow ±30% to change\\nhe CST parameters. In the PSO optimization, the number of itera-\\nions/generation is set to 80, while a group of 40 particles is initialized.\\n\\nFig. 9 shows a typical convergence plot in the optimization process.\\ns the PSO iterations progress, the objective function drops first rapidly\\nnd then converges to the minimal values. From the first to the final\\nteration, about 3 dBA noise is reduced for all AOAs.

The same PSO parameters\\nare used during the optimization. As detailed in Section 3.2.2, the\\nautoencoder generates reasonably good aerodynamic configurations\\nacross a wide range of latent variables. Therefore, the range of all\\nfour latent variables is set to [−3, 3]. All PSO parameters are set the\\nsame as those used for CST-based optimization. In contrast to when\\nusing CST-based optimization, the autoencoder provides multiple final\\ngeometries. Three optimum geometries are depicted in Fig. 11. When\\nchecking the aerodynamic coefficients and the OASPL, see Table 3,\\nwe observe that all geometries have similar values for the objective\\nfunction, but the profiles are now different. In this case, the benchmark\\ngeometry is generated by setting all the latent variables to zero (and\\ndoes not correspond to the NACA0012).\\n\\nThe values of all objective functions, including both CST-based\\n(named as Optimized-1/2/3 (CST)) and autoencoder-based (named\\nas Optimized-1/2/3 (AE)) optimization, are summarized in Table 3.\\nAs shown in the table, both types of parameterization lead to very\\nsimilar objective values, but the autoencoder finds more silent airfoils\\n(in particular, the Optimized-1 (AE)). This indicates that when the\\n9\\n\\noptimized airfoil based on autoencoder (e.g., Optimized-1 (AE)) is used\\nfor wind turbine design, significant reduction of noise can be reached\\n(thus reducing human annoyance levels). Indeed, Table 3 shows the\\noverall noise reduction attained by the optimization framework and\\nthe proposed autoencoder-based parameterization, when considering\\nthree angles of attack. In addition, for each of the angle of attack, the\\naerodynamic and acoustic characteristics is compared in Table 4 (for\\nall AOAs used for optimization, including 0◦, 2◦ and 4◦) and Table 5\\n(for other AOAs including 1◦ and 3◦). Since all three results are quite\\nsimilar, only the best result from CST parameterization is included.\\nThese results are plotted in Fig. 12. Although having similar OASPL,\\nthe aerodynamic properties from autoencoder-based optimization are\\nbetter than those from CST-based optimization. Furthermore, the opti-\\nmal airfoil in terms of OASPL (Optimized-1(AE)) reduces around 2.97%\\nfor all angles of attack (the mean value, corresponding to 1.75 dBA),\\ncompared to the baseline NACA0012 airfoil. This indicates that the\\nautoencoder can fully explore the parameter space to generate optimal\\nairfoils. For completeness, the pressure coefficients of all configurations\\nare compared in Fig. 13.\\n\\nTo compare the noise reduction for optimized configurations,\\nFig. 14 shows the far-field noise spectrum. It is clear that, although the\\nintegrated value (OASPL) is used as the objective, the noise across all\\nfrequency ranges is reduced. Compared with the baseline NACA0012,\\nthe optimized airfoils reduce noise at all frequencies and all angles of\\nattack considered. At a small angle of attack (e.g., AOA = 0◦), optimized\\nairfoils based on autoencoders show lower noise levels at small frequen-\\ncies, compared to optimized airfoils based on CST. On the contrary, the\\noptimized airfoil based on the third autoencoder shows louder noise at\\nhigh frequencies, similar to the baseline airfoil. As the angle of attack\\nis increased, CST, Autoencoder-2 and Autoencoder-3 airfoils behave\\nsimilarly, producing less noise compared to the NACA0012 airfoil.\\nAdditionally, for all operating conditions, the Autoencoder-1 airfoil\\n\\ngives minimal overall noise for all frequencies, which is consistent with\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

We use PSO in the optimization\\nprocess to ensure an efficient global search. We define the objective\\nfunction of the optimization problem as the OASPL across various\\nAOAs, with aerodynamic and geometric constraints. We introduce\\na variational autoencoder to enhance the shape parameterization of\\nairfoils, to reduce the optimized parameters, and to generate a large\\nfamily of airfoils.\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder finds a large family of optimal ge-\\nometries, whereas the classic CST parameterization converges to very\\nsimilar shapes. Both methods find airfoils with comparable objective\\nfunctions, but the variational autoencoder is superior in better satisfy-\\ning the constraints with improved aerodynamic properties. Compared\\nto the baseline geometry (the NACA0012 airfoil), the autoencoder-\\nbased optimized airfoil reduces by 3% the overall sound pressure\\nlevel (about 1.7 dBA in Overall A-weighted Sound Pressure Level,\\nOASPL), while improving aerodynamic performance. We conclude that\\nthe aeroacoustic optimization framework is a very useful tool for wind\\nturbine airfoil design.\\n\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\n\\nJiaqing Kou: Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Soft-\\nare, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.

Parameters in Amiet’s theory\\n\\n.1. Spanwise correlation length\\n\\nA common methodology to obtain the spanwise correlation length\\ns using Corcos’ model (Corcos, 1964), which depends on an empiri-\\nal constant. This constant can be obtained by fitting the coherence\\netween two sensors located along the span of the airfoil; however,\\nt is usually assumed as a constant value. The spanwise correlation\\nength is related to the distance in the spanwise direction where there\\ns a high level of coherence. It can also be related to the size of\\nhe turbulent structures in the spanwise direction. Theoretically, the\\npanwise correlation length is defined as the integral in the entire span\\nf the coherence between two points in the spanwise direction. It can\\ne calculated from the Corcos’ model for the coherence between two\\npanwise points as:\\n\\n𝑧∣𝑃𝑃 = 𝑏𝑐\\n𝑈𝑐\\n𝜔\\n\\n(A.1)\\n\\nwhere 𝑏𝑐 is the Corco’s constant equal to 1.4.\\n\\nA.2. Wall-pressure spectrum\\n\\nThe wall pressure fluctuations in the vicinity of the trailing edge\\nare the near-field noise source of the far-field noise emitted by an\\nairfoil with an attached and turbulent boundary layer. Therefore, it\\nmight be the most important input of Amiet’s model and critical for\\ngeometry optimization procedures. Therefore, a detailed discussion\\nabout obtaining this quantity is explained in Appendix A.2. They are\\ncaused by velocity fluctuations related to the small structures near the\\nairfoil wall and the larger structures in the outer part of the boundary\\nlayer (Glegg & Devenport, 2017). The smaller structures scale with\\nviscous length (𝑢𝜏∕𝜈) and are responsible for the high frequency range\\nof the wall pressure spectrum, whereas the larger turbulent structures\\nscale with the boundary layer thickness (𝛿) and are responsible for the\\nlow frequency range of the wall pressure spectrum. The mid-frequency\\nrange scales with both types of structures. Based on this theory, several\\n\\nsemiempirical models have been proposed to model the wall pressure\\n\\nhttp://www.upm.es\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Other model is the one proposed by Blake\\n(2017) which is based on physical analysis by solving the Poisson’s\\nequation, which governs the relationship between the velocity fluctua-\\ntions across the boundary layer and the wall-pressure fluctuations in the\\nairfoil wall. The model proposed by Blake (2017) was later extended\\nby Parchen (1998) and is now known as the TNO-Blake model. The\\nTNO-Blake model incorporates more physics and takes into account\\nseveral turbulence quantities, and not only integral quantities as in\\nsemiempirical models. For this reason, we retain this model to perform\\nthe optimization procedures presented in this work.\\n\\nThe TNO-Blake model is proposed based on the solution of the\\nPoison equation that results from the divergence of the Navier–Stokes\\nequation simplified by the continuity equation. The model can be\\napplied to calculate the wall-pressure spectrum close to the trailing\\nedge, however, the turbulence quantities are calculated assuming that\\nthe discontinuity of the trailing edge does not affect the turbulence.\\nFurthermore, the model assumes that the turbulent pressure and ve-\\nlocity field are spatially homogeneous and stationary on time. The\\nwall pressure spectrum can be calculated in the wavenumber–frequency\\ndomain by applying the Fourier transform in time–space Fourier trans-\\nform. Therefore, the wall pressure spectrum would depend on the\\nwavenumber in the chordwise direction (𝜅𝑥) and spanwise direction\\n𝜅𝑧). Integration in 𝜅𝑧 can be conducted by introducing the spanwise\\norrelation length that depends on the frequency 𝛬𝑧|𝑝𝑝3(𝜔). In this re-\\nearch, we follow the TNO-Blake model extension proposed by Stalnov\\nt al. (2016), which also considers the anisotropy of the turbulence by\\nncorporating the stretching parameters.\\n\\nThe single-point wall pressure spectrum can be calculated as fol-\\nows:\\n\\npp(𝜔) =\\n4𝜋𝜌2\\n\\n𝛬𝑧∣𝑃𝑃 (𝜔) ∫\\n\\n𝛿\\n\\n0\\n𝛬𝑦∣𝑣𝑣(𝑦)𝑈𝑐 (𝑦)\\n\\n[\\n\\n𝜕𝑈 (𝑦)\\n𝜕𝑦\\n\\n]2\\n\\n×\\n𝑢2𝑦(𝑦)\\n\\n𝑈2\\n𝑐 (𝑦)\\n\\n𝜙𝑣𝑣(𝜅𝑥, 𝜅𝑧 = 0)𝑒−2∣𝜅∣𝑦𝑑𝑦 (A.2)\\n\\nwhere 𝛿 is the thickness of the boundary layer, 𝛬𝑦∣𝑣𝑣(𝑦) is the integral\\nlength scale across the boundary layer in the 𝑦 direction, i.e., in the\\ndirection of the boundary layer, perpendicular to the airfoil wall.

Mean velocity profile\\nThe mean velocity across the boundary layer is modeled by the\\n\\nuniversal von-Kármán log law of the wall coupled with the Coles’ wake\\nfactor (𝛱𝑤) that accounts for the pressure gradient (Coles, 1956), as:\\n\\n𝑈 (𝑦)\\n𝑢𝜏\\n\\n= 1\\n𝜅\\nlog\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝑦+\\n)\\n\\n+ 𝐵 +\\n2𝛱𝑤\\n𝜅\\n\\nsin2\\n(𝜋𝑦\\n2𝛿\\n\\n)\\n\\n𝑦+ ≤ 5\\n\\n𝑈 (𝑦)\\n𝑢𝜏\\n\\n= 𝑦+ 𝑦+ < 5\\n\\n𝛱𝑤 = 0.8\\n(\\n\\n𝛿∗\\n\\n𝜏𝑤\\n\\nd𝐶𝑝\\n\\nd𝑥\\n+ 0.5\\n\\n)3∕4\\n\\n𝑢𝜏 =\\n√\\n\\n1\\n2\\n𝑐𝑓𝑈2\\n\\n∞\\n\\n(A.4)\\n\\nhere 𝑢𝜏 is the friction velocity, 𝜅 is the von Kárman constant (=0.38),\\n𝐵 is the level constant (=5), 𝑦+ is the non-dimensional distance from the\\nwall, 𝑦+ = 𝑦𝑢𝜏∕𝜈, 𝐶𝑝 the pressure coefficient, 𝜏𝑤 is the local wall shear\\nstress equal to 𝜏𝑤 = 0.5𝜌𝑈2\\n\\n∞𝑐𝑓 , and 𝑐𝑓 is the local friction coefficient.\\nFor the calculation of the mean velocity across the boundary layer, d𝐶𝑝\\n\\nd𝑥\\nnd 𝑐𝑓 are obtained from XFOIL.\\n\\nA.3.3. Turbulence intensities\\nTo calculate the velocity fluctuations in the streamwise direction,\\n\\nthe model proposed by Alfredsson, Örlü, and Segalini (2011) is used,\\nas shown in Eq. (A.5), where 𝛾 = 64, 𝑎 = 0.2909, and 𝑏 = 0.2598. These\\nalues were obtained empirically for a zero pressure gradient boundary\\nayer. To calculate the velocity fluctuations in the other direction, the\\ntretching parameters for anisotropic turbulence are adopted, i.e. 𝛽𝑥 =\\n, 𝛽𝑦 = 1∕2, 𝛽𝑧 = 3∕4. Thus, 𝑢2𝑦 = 𝛽𝑦𝑢2𝑥 and 𝑢2𝑧 = 𝛽𝑧𝑢2𝑥.\\n\\n𝑢𝑥(𝑦)\\n𝑈 (𝑦)\\n\\n=\\n(\\n\\n𝑎 − 𝑏\\n(\\n\\n𝑈 (𝑦)\\n𝑈∞\\n\\n))\\n\\n𝑄\\n\\n𝑄 = 1 − 𝑒−𝛾\\n(\\n\\n1− 𝑈 (𝑦)\\n𝑈∞\\n\\n)\\n\\n(A.5)\\n\\nA.3.4. Integral length scale\\nThe length scale relevant for wall pressure fluctuations is the one in\\n\\nthe transversal direction of the boundary layer, i.e. the vertical size of\\nthe eddies (𝛬𝑦∣𝑣𝑣(𝑦)). It can be calculated using the model of Schlichting\\nand Kestin (1961) using the concept of mixing length (𝑙mix):\\n\\n𝛬𝑦∣𝑣𝑣(𝑦) =\\n𝑙mix\\n𝑘\\n\\n𝑙mix =\\n0.085𝛿 tanh\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝑘\\n0.085\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝑦\\n𝛿\\n\\n))\\n\\n√\\n\\n1 + 𝐵 (𝑦∕𝛿)6\\n\\n(A.6)\\n\\nThe integral length scale in the streamwise direction can be calcu-\\nlated assuming isotropic turbulence, i.e., 𝛬𝑥∣𝑢𝑢(𝑦) = 2𝛬𝑦∣𝑣𝑣(𝑦)\\n\\nA.3.5. Velocity spectrum\\nThe calculation of the velocity spectrum is based on the von Kármán\\n\\nmodel for the energy spectrum of isotropic turbulence integrated over\\n𝜅𝑦. The incorporation of the stretching parameters accounts for the\\nanisotropy, as shown in Eq. (A.7), where 𝜅𝑒 is the wavenumber of\\nthe eddies that contains most of the energy, therefore related to the\\nstreamwise integral length scale.\\n\\n𝜙𝑣𝑣 = 4\\n9𝜋\\n\\n𝛽𝑥𝛽𝑧\\n𝜅2\\n𝑒\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝛽𝑥𝜅𝑥∕𝜅𝑒\\n)2 +\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝛽𝑧𝜅𝑧∕𝜅𝑒\\n)2\\n\\n[\\n\\n1 +\\n(\\n\\n𝛽𝑥𝜅𝑥∕𝜅𝑒\\n)2 +\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝛽𝑧𝜅𝑧∕𝜅𝑒\\n)2\\n]7∕3\\n\\n𝜅𝑒(𝑦) =\\n\\n√\\n\\n𝜋 𝛤 (5∕6)\\n(A.7)\\n𝛬𝑥∣𝑢𝑢 𝛤 (1∕3)\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Airfoils with maximum and minimum thicknesses in the UIUC database. The\\nGOE 9K is a low-thickness airfoil from the early days of aviation, while the Wortmann\\nFX-79-W-660A is a thick airfoil for use on wind turbines.\\n\\nFig. B.16. Example of an airfoil, from the UIUC database, used for training. The airfoil\\nis discretized with 198 points (shown as dots on the airfoil surface).\\n\\nAppendix B. UIUC database\\n\\nThe training data for the autoencoder has been obtained from the\\nUIUC airfoil database (Selig, 1996). To deal with the disparity in\\nnumber of discretization points for each airfoil in the database, all\\nairfoil shapes have been re-defined by interpolation to 198 cosine-\\nspaced 𝑥 points, allowing the use of only the 𝑦 coordinate as the input\\nparameter to the autoencoder:\\n\\n𝑥𝑖 =\\n1\\n2\\n\\n(\\n\\ncos\\n2𝜋(𝑖 − 1)\\n\\n198\\n+ 1\\n\\n)\\n\\n𝑖 = 1, 2,… , 198. (B.1)\\n\\ndditionally, the leading edge point (𝑥 = 𝑦 = 0) has been removed\\nor all airfoils due to it being equal for all shapes and thus not useful\\nor training. Blunt (non-zero thickness) trailing edge airfoils have been\\nodified into sharp trailing edge airfoils by finding the intersection\\n13\\nbetween the upper and lower surfaces and extending them to the end\\npoint.\\n\\nFinally, 1427 airfoil samples defined by 198 𝑦-coordinate points\\neach have been used for training. As detailed in Table B.6, this database\\nencompasses a broad range of non-dimensional airfoil thicknesses 𝑡∕𝑐,\\ndefined as the maximum vertical distance between upper and lower\\nsurfaces for a given airfoil. Two airfoils with maximum and minimum\\nthicknesses in the database are shown in Fig. B.15. Furthermore, the\\nsurface discretization of the airfoil (i.e., distribution of 198 points on\\nthe surface) is shown in Fig. B.16. Note that all airfoils share the same\\ncoordinates in the 𝑥-direction.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAlfredsson, P. H., Örlü, R., & Segalini, A. (2011).

To this end, we present a framework for airfoil shape optimization\\nto reduce the trailing edge noise for the design of wind turbine blades. Far-field noise is evaluated using\\nAmiet’s theory coupled with the TNO-Blake model to calculate the wall pressure spectrum and fast turn-around\\nXFOIL simulations to evaluate the boundary layer parameters. The computational framework is first validated\\nusing a NACA0012 airfoil at 0◦ angle of attack. Particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimized\\nairfoil configuration. The multi-objective optimization minimizes the A-weighted overall sound pressure level\\nat various angles of attack, while ensuring enough lift and minimum drag. Furthermore, traditional shape\\noptimization techniques show difficulties to converge to the optimum, when too many shape parameters are\\nincluded in the optimization. For this reason, we compare classic parameterization methods to define the\\nairfoil geometry (i.e., CST) to a machine learning method (i.e., a variational autoencoder). We observe that\\nvariational autoencoders can represent a wide variety of geometries, with only four encoded variables, leading\\nto efficient optimizations, which result in improved optimal shapes. When compared to the baseline geometry, a\\nNACA0012, the autoencoder-based optimized airfoil reduces by 3% (1.75 dBA) the overall sound pressure level\\n(with decreased noise across the entire frequency range), while maintaining favorable aerodynamic properties\\nin terms of lift and drag.\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nWind turbine noise has typically been one of the main drawbacks of\\nthe wide deployment and acceptance of wind devices for the generation\\nof clean energy. The interest in controlling turbine acoustics is increas-\\ning since turbines are now being integrated in urban environments,\\nwhere noise nuisances can be of great concern (Hubbard & Shepherd,\\n2009; Rogers, Manwell, & Wright, 2006). Wind turbine aeroacoustics is\\na complex phenomenon that includes several sources of noise. The most\\ncritical noise sources of a typical wind turbine are: (1) steady loading,\\nwhich relates to the distribution of forces along the blade leading to\\nbroadband noise; (2) unsteady loading caused by the incoming sheared\\nand turbulent atmospheric flow, associated with low frequency noise;\\nand (3) airfoil self-noise, which encompasses various high frequency\\nphenomena that relate to the boundary layer and eddies generated as\\nthe air passes the blades.\\n\\nAirfoil self-noise (Brooks, Pope, & Marcolini, 1989) is the minimum\\namount of noise produced by an aerodynamic surface and is the main\\n\\n∗ Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: jiaqing.kou@alumnos.upm.es (J.

It is caused by the interaction of the turbulent boundary\\nlayer with the blade surface close to the trailing edge, when the\\nhydrodynamic pressure fluctuations originated in the airfoil surface\\nare scattered to the far field as noise, due to the sudden change of\\nimpedance in the blade trailing edge discontinuity (Stalnov, Chaitanya,\\n& Joseph, 2016). To generate quiet wind turbines, it is necessary\\nto select airfoils that minimize noise generation in operational con-\\nditions (e.g. attached flow). Typical turbine airfoils were designed\\nto be insensitive to roughness, by promoting the transition near the\\nleading edge (Bertagnolio, Sørensen, Johansen, & Fuglsang, 2001),\\nwhile noise generation was often neglected. However, social pressure\\nto minimize wind farm noise leads to considering acoustics during\\nthe design phase of new airfoils. The SIROCO project (Humpf, Ferrer,\\n& Munduate, 2007; Lutz, Herrig, Würz, Kamruzzaman, & Krämer,\\n2007; Schepers et al., 2007) incorporated aeroacoustic predictions for\\nshape optimization design.

Kou et al.\\n\\nt\\nd\\ns\\na\\ns\\ni\\n\\npredict airfoil trailing edge far-field noise, by combining XFOIL, a\\nfinite-difference code, and a modified TNO-TPD model. The method\\nhas been used to design new, less-noisy airfoils without loss in aero-\\ndynamic performance. Similarly, Hao, Zhang, Liu, and Liu (2008)\\nintroduced aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimization of the wind\\nturbine blade using a genetic algorithm. Lee, Lee, Ryi, and Choi (2013)\\noptimized the airfoils of the wind turbine based on genetic algorithms,\\nto reduce airfoil self-noise, and validated the results by wind tunnel\\nexperiment. Rodrigues and Marta (2014) performed multi-objective op-\\ntimization to design wind turbine blades, where an increase in annual\\nenergy production of 15% was achieved with a reduction in noise levels\\nof 9.8%. Zhou et al. (2015) proposed a discrete adjoint framework\\nfor unsteady aerodynamic aeroacoustic optimization. More recently,\\nVolkmer and Carolus (2018) performed aeroacoustic airfoil shape opti-\\nmization based on semi-empirical aeroacoustic models. There, XFOIL\\nis combined with Amiet’s model and evolutionary optimization to\\ndesign airfoils with less noise while maintaining the required lift. Ricks,\\nTsirikoglou, Contino, and Ghorbaniasl (2020) proposed multi-objective\\naerodynamic-aeroacoustic shape optimization of airfoils based on a\\nReynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver with a state-of-the-art wall\\npressure spectrum model and Amiet’s model for trailing edge noise. Bu,\\nSong, Han, Zhang, and Zhang (2020) developed the framework for\\naerodynamic/aeroacoustic variable-fidelity optimization of helicopter\\nrotor based on hierarchical Kriging model. These works show the effi-\\nciency of using Amiet’s theory and XFOIL for aeroacoustic optimization,\\nwhereas recent machine learning strategies (e.g., autoencoders) have\\nnot been considered.\\n\\nMachine learning (ML) techniques are permeating in all fields of\\nfluid dynamics (Brunton & Kutz, 2019; Garnier et al., 2021; Kou\\n& Zhang, 2021; leClainche et al., 2022; Vinuesa & Brunton, 2022;\\nYondo, Andrés, & Valero, 2018) and aerodynamic optimization; see\\nthe recent review by Li, Du, and Martins (2022). ML can be used as\\na surrogate model to replace the expensive flow simulations (Sun &\\nWang, 2019). For example, Boutemedjet, Samardžić, Rebhi, Rajić, and\\nMouada (2019) proposed the aerodynamic design procedure of a mini\\nunmanned aerial vehicle involving genetic algorithms and artificial\\nneural networks for wing preliminary computation. Liao, Song, Du, and\\nZhao (2021) introduced multi-fidelity convolutional neural networks as\\na surrogate model for aerodynamic optimization. Moreover, Yan, Zhu,\\nKuang, and Wang (2019) developed an optimizer based on reinforce-\\nment learning and transfer learning, to enhance aerodynamic shape\\noptimization.\\n\\nIn particular, unsupervised ML techniques for dimensionality reduc-\\ntion enable the treatment of problems with a large number of variables\\nby coding the information into a reduced number of parameters (i.e., la-\\ntent variables). Neural networks are ideal for representing nonlinear\\nfunctions and can thus encode information very efficiently in very\\nfew latent variables. Autoencoders (AEs) are artificial neural networks\\nthat can reduce the dataset information (encoding), but that can also\\nreconstruct (decode) the original data, minimizing the reconstruction\\nerror. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) improve the behavior of classic\\nautoencoders by enforcing latent variables to follow smooth statistical\\ndistributions (typically normal distributions) (Kingma & Welling, 2013;\\nZhao, Song, & Ermon, 2017). By doing so, it is possible to avoid discon-\\ntinuities in the latent variables, which helps to reconstruct the original\\ndatabase. Another advantage of requiring smooth latent variables is\\nthat they can be used for optimization.\\n\\nVAEs have not been widely adopted for optimization. In fact, to\\nthe authors’ knowledge, only Rios et al. (2021) have used VAEs\\nfor car optimization. They showed the superiority of this technique\\nin incorporating local geometric features, when compared to modal\\ntechniques (e.g., principal component analysis). Additionally, Yonekura\\nand Suzuki (2021) have shown the advantages of VAEs to represent\\nairfoils using latent variables, but did not perform optimizations.\\n\\nEncouraged by the previous work, in this work we propose using\\nVAEs to enhance the aeroacoustic optimization of wind turbine air-\\n2\\n\\nfoils. We target the airfoil self-noise using Amiet’s theory and develop\\nan optimization framework that targets improved aerodynamics with\\nminimum noise in the design. We include VAEs for the parameteri-\\nzation of the airfoil geometry and compare this technique with the\\nCST method (Kulfan & Bussoletti, 2006) to parameterize the airfoil\\ngeometry. Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed framework, including the\\ninputs and outputs, as well as the basic workflow of the optimization\\nframework. As will be shown in the results, VAEs show superiority and\\nenhanced robustness over CST. The main contributions of this work\\nare: (1) We develop a framework for aeroacoustic shape optimization;\\n(2) We incorporate autoencoders to enhance shape parameterization.\\nThe results show the superior capabilities of the aeroacoustic shape\\noptimization framework when enhanced by autoencoders.\\n\\nThe remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 in-\\ntroduces the far-field noise prediction framework, including the aeroa-\\ncoustic and aerodynamic models, as well as the validation of the\\nframework. The optimization framework is introduced in Section 3,\\nwhere the shape parameterization including CST and VAEs, the op-\\ntimization algorithm, and the problem formulation are detailed. The\\noptimization results are summarized in Section 4. Conclusions are\\nprovided in Section 5.\\n\\n2. Far-field noise prediction\\n\\nThis section introduces the computational models used in the\\npresent study, including the aerodynamic and acoustic models. Amiet’s\\ntheory (Amiet, 1976) is adopted here for the trailing edge noise pre-\\ndiction. The theory calculates the far-field acoustic pressure spectrum\\nusing the wall pressure wavenumber–frequency spectral density in the\\nvicinity of the trailing edge as input. This theory assumes a large span,\\na stationary observer and airfoil, and a uniform flow, and that the\\nboundary layer turbulence is convecting over the trailing edge as a\\nfrozen pattern, i.e., the turbulence is not affected by the discontinuity\\nof the trailing edge.\\n\\n2.1. The acoustic model\\n\\nEq. (1) presents the far-field power spectral density of an airfoil of\\nchord c and span b for an observer perpendicular to the trailing edge\\nat midspan (z0 = 0) (Stalnov et al., 2016):\\n\\n𝑆𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑜, 𝑦𝑜, 𝑧𝑜 = 0, 𝜔) =\\n(\\n\\n𝜔𝑐𝑦𝑜\\n4𝜋𝑐𝑜𝜎2\\n\\n)\\n\\n𝑏\\n2\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\nℒ (𝜅𝑥, 𝜅𝑧 = 0, 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑈∞, 𝑈𝑐 )\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n2\\n\\n× 𝛬𝑧|𝑃𝑃𝛱pp(𝜔). (1)\\n\\nIn this equation, 𝜔 is the angular frequency (= 2𝜋𝑓 ), and 𝑥𝑜, 𝑦𝑜, 𝑧𝑜 is\\nhe observer location. The reference system adopts 𝑥 in the streamwise\\nirection, 𝑦 in the direction perpendicular to the wall and 𝑧 in the\\npanwise direction, with 𝑥 = 𝑦 = 𝑧 = 0 at the trailing edge of the\\nirfoil in the mid-span. 𝑐𝑜 is the speed of sound, 𝜅𝑥 and 𝜅𝑧 are the\\npatial wavenumber in the 𝑥 and 𝑧 directions, and 𝑈𝑐 = 0.6 × 𝑈∞\\ns the mean convection velocity. ℒ is the airfoil response function\\n\\nproposed by Amiet (1976) which is the transfer between hydrodynamic\\nwall pressure fluctuations caused by the turbulent boundary layer and\\nacoustic waves in the far field. Amiet considered a flat plate, therefore,\\nℒ is constant among the different airfoils. The implementation of ℒ\\nfollowed in this work, was proposed by Roger and Moreau (2005)\\nand considers the backscattering effect of the leading edge. 𝛬𝑧|𝑃𝑃 is\\nthe spanwise correlation length, which is related to the size of the\\nvortices in the spanwise direction. Finally, 𝛱pp(𝜔) is the wall pressure\\nspectrum in the vicinity of the trailing edge and is comparable to the\\nmeasurements of a sensor located on the airfoil surface. The wall-\\npressure spectrum is the only quantity that is different for each airfoil\\nfacing the same inflow conditions. The wall-pressure spectrum is calcu-\\nlated using the TNO-Blake model, explained in detail in Appendix A.2.\\nAdditional details on how to compute the various parameters in Eq.

XFOIL is a viscous-\\ninviscid iterative software code that does not require any prior mesh\\npreparation. The inviscid pressure distribution is modeled using a linear\\nvortex strength distribution. Viscous effects and the development of\\nthe laminar-turbulent boundary layer are modeled using linear stability\\n(i.e., the e method) and integral boundary layer theory. The XFOIL\\noutputs are used to calculate the wall pressure spectrum, which, in turn,\\nis used to predict the far-field noise produced by the airfoil.\\n\\nIn all the cases included in this work, we fix the boundary layer\\ntransition near the leading edge in both pressure and suction sides,\\nto mimic the insensitivity to roughness that is commonly sought in\\nwind turbine airfoils. The number of panel nodes is set to 160 and the\\nnumber of iterations to 1000.\\n\\n2.3. Methodology validation: NACA0012 airfoil\\n\\nTo validate the trailing edge noise prediction methodology, a widely\\nstudied airfoil in the literature, i.e., a NACA 0012 airfoil is used,\\ncomparing our results with those obtained in the literature. The airfoil\\nis assumed to have a 0.4 m chord and a 1 m span. The far-field observer\\nis located at 1 m from the airfoil trailing edge at mid-span, i.e., 𝑥 = 0,\\n𝑦 = 1 m, and 𝑧 = 0. The wall pressure spectrum is calculated at\\n𝑥∕𝑐 = 0.99. The boundary layer transition is fixed at 𝑥∕𝑐 = 0.06\\non both sides. The angle of attack is fixed at 0◦. The inflow velocity\\nis assumed to be 56 m∕s, which corresponds to a Reynolds number of\\n1.5 × 106 and a Mach number of 0.16. The frequency resolution is 1 Hz\\nand the far-field noise 𝑆pp is calculated from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. Sound\\npressure level (SPL) is calculated at the observer location by\\n\\n𝑆𝑃𝐿 = 20 log10\\n𝑝\\n\\n𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n, (2)\\n\\nwhere 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the acoustic pressure reference, that for air, is 20 μPa, and\\n𝑝 is the far field pressure, obtained from the sum of the power spectral\\ndensity (𝑆𝑝𝑝 from Eq. (1)) from both, pressure and suction side, and\\nmultiplied by the frequency resolution.\\n\\nComparisons have been conducted with experimental results re-\\nported in Herr et al. (2012) (results have been scaled to match the\\npresented conditions) and with noise prediction using Amiet’s the-\\nory coupled with the semi-empirical model proposed by Kamruzza-\\nman, Bekiropoulos, Lutz, Würz, and Krämer (2015) and RANS sim-\\nulations (Küçükosman et al., 2018). Fig. 2 shows the far-field noise\\nspectrum in 1/3 octave for the predicted far-field using the methodol-\\nogy presented in this paper and in the literature. Additionally, Table 1\\nshows the integrated pressure level of the spectrum for the same cases,\\nbetween a frequency range of 1000 to 6300 Hz, i.e., the frequency\\nrange where all data is available. The results suggest that the ap-\\nplied methodology, i.e., XFOIL coupled with the TNO-Blake model and\\nAmiet’s theory, is appropriate to predict trailing edge noise and agrees\\n3\\n\\nFig. 2.

The validation indicates that the proposed method provides re-\\nsults with comparable accuracy to more costly flow solvers, while being\\nfast enough to be used for optimization, where multiple evaluations of\\nthe acoustic performance are needed for different airfoils.\\n\\n3. Optimization framework\\n\\nThe optimization framework is introduced, including the parameter-\\nization of the shape, the optimization algorithm, and the formulation\\nof the problem (objective function and constraints). As a key ingredient\\nto enhance aeroacoustic shape optimization, a variational autoencoder\\nis introduced to parameterize the airfoil surfaces. Fig. 3 shows the\\nframework for aeroacoustic shape optimization. As shown in the figure,\\nthree main steps are needed:\\n\\nStep 1: Get design variables (shape parameterization) and recon-\\nstruct the airfoil geometry (based on CST parameters, or latent variables\\nand decoder part of autoencoders). The design variables are initialized\\nat the beginning of the optimization and are further updated based on\\nthe optimization algorithm.\\n\\nStep 2: Given each airfoil shape in Step 1, evaluate the correspond-\\ning aerodynamic and acoustic properties, through XFoil and Amiet’s\\ntheory, respectively.\\n\\nStep 3: Check if the aerodynamic properties satisfy the constraint,\\nand calculate the fitness function from the acoustic property (for each\\nparticle). Moreover, update the particle (i.e., design variables for the\\nevaluation in the next generation) based on the PSO algorithm. If\\nthe optimization does not converge, repeat these steps for the next\\ngeneration of the PSO algorithm.\\n\\nMore details about the optimization framework will be given in the\\nnext subsection.\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Aeroacoustic shape optimization framework.\\n\\n3.1. Problem formulation: optimization objective and constraints\\n\\nIn this study, we are interested in geometric optimization for noise\\nminimization. Therefore, the Overall A-weighted Sound Pressure Level\\n(OASPL) is selected as the objective function. The OASPL is used to\\nweight the spectrum energy in the frequency domain with the sensi-\\ntivity of human hearing, resulting in optimized geometries suitable for\\nwind turbines located near urban areas. Since the optimized airfoil is\\nexpected to work on multiple operating conditions, the multi-objective\\noptimization is needed. Therefore, we formulated this problem by\\nconsidering the overall OASPL for various angles of attack (AOAs)\\nas the objective function. Meanwhile, to maintain reasonable aero-\\ndynamic performance and reasonable geometries, several constraints\\nshould be satisfied. Therefore, the following objective and constraints\\nare selected:\\n\\nmin\\n𝑏∕𝑧\\n\\n𝑠\\n∑\\n\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑂𝐴𝑆𝑃𝐿(𝐴𝑂𝐴𝑖), (3)\\n\\nsubject to 𝐶𝑙,𝑖 ≥ 𝐶𝑙0,𝑖 ; 𝐶𝑑,𝑖 ≤ 𝐶𝑑0,𝑖,\\n\\n𝑇 ≤ 𝑇0,\\n\\nmin(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) > 0 ; 0 < 𝑥 < 1,\\n\\n𝑇Leading ≥ 𝑇Trailing.\\n\\nwhere 𝑏 and 𝑧 refer to the CST parameters or the latent variable\\nof the autoencoder. 𝑇 refers to the maximal thickness of the airfoil.\\nThe sum of OASPL at the 𝑠 angle of attack is used to evaluate the\\nobjective function. The parameter with subscript 0 refers to the baseline\\ngeometry, where the NACA0012 airfoil is chosen for all angles of attack.\\nTo maintain reasonable aerodynamic performance, we do not expect\\na drop in lift or an increase in drag, compared to the baseline case.\\n4\\n\\nTherefore, the first group of constraints is imposed: 𝐶𝑙,𝑖 ≥ 𝐶𝑙0,𝑖, 𝐶𝑑,𝑖 ≤\\n𝐶𝑑0,𝑖, where 𝐶𝑙0 and 𝐶𝑑0 refer to the lift and drag coefficients of the\\nbaseline geometry, respectively. The constraint applies to all AOAs\\nconsidered during optimization. All of them are hard constraints that\\nmust be satisfied during the optimization process; therefore, a suit-\\nable constraint handling technique is needed and will be explained\\nhereafter.\\n\\nApart from aerodynamic considerations, the constraints ensure the\\ngeneration of realistic airfoil geometries. From previous studies on\\naeroacoustic optimization (Brian, William, & Anastasios, 1998; Mon-\\nfaredi, Trompoukis, Tsiakas, & Giannakoglou, 2021; Zhou et al., 2015),\\noptimal aeroacoustic geometry generally does not produce improved\\naerodynamic performance. Therefore, to improve the optimization ef-\\nficiency, geometrical considerations are introduced as constraints. Al-\\nthough a thinner airfoil is expected to be more silent, the second\\nconstraint (𝑇 ≤ 𝑇0) limits the thickness of the airfoil to avoid being\\nthicker than the benchmark airfoil. This is required to ensure structural\\ncapabilities/resistance in the final geometry (Ricks et al., 2020). The\\nthird constraint min(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) > 0 ; 0 < 𝑥 < 1, ensures that\\nthe upper and lower surfaces do not cross each other (e.g., negative\\nvolume shapes). To satisfy this condition, the difference between the\\nupper layer and the lower layer, given the same 𝑥 coordinate, should\\nalways be positive. Moreover, the last constraint 𝑇Leading ≥ 𝑇Trailing\\ndemands that the first half of the airfoil is thicker than the second half,\\nto ensure a reasonable aerodynamic configuration. The two thickness\\nparameters are defined as follows:\\n\\n𝑇Leading = max(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) ; 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 0.5, (4)\\n𝑇Trailing = max(𝑦𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑥) − 𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟(𝑥)) ; 0.5 < 𝑥 ≤ 1.\\n\\nThe optimization framework is illustrated in Fig. 3. As shown in\\nthe figure, the entire optimization framework involves three main\\ncomponents: (1) design variables (geometrical parameterization); (2)\\naerodynamic and aeroacoustic models; (3) optimizer (optimization al-\\ngorithm and constraint handling). In the current study, the second and\\nthird components are fixed, while two different methods for geometri-\\ncal parameterization have been considered (CST and autoencoder) to\\nshow the potential of machine learning to enhance aeroacoustic shape\\noptimization.\\n\\nIt should be noted that the optimization results depend heavily\\non the problem formulation (Brian et al., 1998). Therefore, if other\\nconstraints are used, the results can be different. In the present work,\\nthe aim is not to propose a new acoustic geometry but rather to show\\nthe capability of autoencoders to enhance the optimization problem.\\nTo complete the optimization algorithm, robust constraint handling\\ntechniques should be considered (Biswas, Suganthan, Mallipeddi, &\\nAmaratunga, 2020; Kuk et al., 2021). Different methods for constraint\\nhandling have been summarized by Kuk et al. (2021), such as discard-\\ning/modifying unfeasible solutions and transforming objective func-\\ntions, etc. Here, we choose to replace unfeasible solutions by randomly\\ngenerating new solutions (Roy & Bhui, 2013), which is beneficial for\\nglobal searches. At each PSO iteration, the particle is first evaluated\\nbased on the constraints, and is discarded if the constraints are not\\nsatisfied. The discarded particle will be replaced by a new particle\\nrandomly generated in the sampling space.\\n\\nFinally, the range of shape parameters, including the CST shape\\nparameters or latent variable of the autoencoder, should be predeter-\\nmined before the optimization starts. For CST parameterization, we\\nhave observed that if the parameter ranges are not properly chosen,\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Variational autoencoder.\\nFOIL can easily stagnate into an infinite loop that hinders the con-\\nergence of the optimization. This is due to the fact that CST does\\not always produce reasonable geometries. Therefore, we chose to\\nerturb the CST parameters of a baseline airfoil (the NACA0012 airfoil),\\nnd the CST parameters are allowed to vary between ±30% of the\\n\\nbaseline parameters. In contrast, since the autoencoder is trained from\\na database of real airfoils, it generates new geometry that follows the\\ntraining database. Therefore, the entire optimization process is easier\\nto converge; thus a wider range of geometrical parameters (latent\\nvariables) can be selected. The optimization process converges when\\nthe predefined number of iterations/generations is reached.\\n\\nDetails on the airfoil shape parameterization, variational autoen-\\ncoders and PSO algorithm will be given in the following subsections.\\n\\n3.2. Airfoil shape parameterization\\n\\nThe review by Li et al. (2022) provides an overview of the tech-\\nniques for airfoil shape parameterization. Our aim in this work is to\\nassess the suitability of variational autoencoders for shape parame-\\nterization when performing optimization. To show the potential of\\nautoencoders, we compare optimization using classic well-established\\nCST parameterization with a variational autoencoder parameterization\\ntechnique.\\n\\n3.2.1. CST parameterization\\nThe Class/Shape function Transformation (CST), proposed by Kul-\\n\\nfan and Bussoletti (2006) in 2006, is a classic and commonly used\\nmethod to represent/parameterize airfoils. CST describes the two-\\ndimensional airfoil (with chord length 𝑐) as the product of a class\\nunction 𝐶(𝑥∕𝑐) and a shape function 𝑆(𝑥∕𝑐), plus a term that considers\\n\\nthe trailing edge thickness (𝛥𝑧𝑡𝑒∕𝑐) (Ceze, Hayashi, & Volpe, 2009;\\nSripawadkul, Padulo, & Guenov, 2010):\\n𝑦\\n𝑐\\n= 𝐶\\n\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)\\n\\n𝑆\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)\\n\\n+ 𝑥\\n𝑐\\n𝛥𝑧𝑡𝑒\\n𝑐\\n\\n, (5)\\n\\nhere the class function 𝐶(𝑥∕𝑐) is given by:\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)\\n\\n=\\n(𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)𝑁1 (\\n\\n1 − 𝑥\\n𝑐\\n\\n)𝑁2\\n, 0 ≤ 𝑥\\n\\n𝑐\\n≤ 1. (6)\\n\\nThe exponents 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 are set to 0.5 and 1.0 for a general airfoil\\nshape. This ensures a round leading edge (\\n\\n√\\n\\n𝑥∕𝑐) and a sharp trailing\\ndge (1 − 𝑥). To generate arbitrary airfoils, a Bernstein polynomial is\\nsed for the shape function:\\n(𝑥) =\\n\\n𝑛\\n∑\\n\\n[\\n\\n𝑏𝑖 ⋅𝐾𝑖,𝑛 ⋅\\n(𝑥)𝑖\\n\\n⋅\\n(\\n\\n1 − 𝑥)𝑛−𝑖\\n]\\n\\n, 𝐾𝑖,𝑛 =\\n𝑛! , (7)\\n5\\n\\n𝑐 𝑖=0 𝑐 𝑐 𝑖!(𝑛 − 𝑖)!\\nwhere 𝑏𝑖 is the design parameter of the CST method. To generate\\nsmooth and well-defined airfoil configurations, the 𝑥 coordinates are\\nspaced using conventional cosine clustering, with 200 coordinates in\\ntotal.\\n\\n3.2.2. Autoencoder-based parameterization\\nAs a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, autoencoders\\n\\nhave been used for many engineering applications, such as uncertainty\\nquantification (Yong & Brintrup, 2022), object detection (Scarpiniti,\\nSarv Ahrabi, Baccarelli, Piazzo, & Momenzadeh, 2022), turbulent flow\\nprediction (Eivazi, Le Clainche, Hoyas, & Vinuesa, 2022), etc. Varia-\\ntional autoencoders have been introduced as a new parameterization\\nmethod, which can enhance the parameterization of airfoils (Yonekura\\n& Suzuki, 2021). VAEs allow for efficient random and guided sampling\\nof novel airfoils from the lower-dimensional latent space of variables,\\navoiding nonphysical shapes, while allowing for a wide variety of\\nshapes.\\n\\nThe proposed VAE has been trained using the UIUC airfoil coordi-\\nnate database (Selig, 1996), using 198 cosine-spaced points per airfoil.\\nMore details of the database can be found in Appendix B. Since the\\n𝑥 spacing for every airfoil is the same, only the vertical coordinate\\n𝑦 is needed to train the network. The architecture (Fig. 4) consists\\nof a symmetrically fully connected multilayer perceptron architecture\\n(MLP) with a variable number of latent features 𝑛 between the encoder\\nand decoder parts. The resulting network is capable of generating airfoil\\nshapes by decoding an input set of 𝑛 latent variables, as shown in Fig. 4.\\nBy condensing the information from the original airfoil database into\\na lower-dimensional latent space, this allows for faster optimization\\niterations by means of dimensionality reduction (see Fig. 4).\\n\\nLatent variables contain valuable geometric information about the\\nairfoil coordinates. For example, using only 𝑛 = 4 latent variable\\ngenerator, we can obtain a large family of airfoils, as shown in Fig. 5.\\nThe loss function \\ue232 , which is the sum of the reconstruction loss and\\nthe Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence; see Eq. (8) can be minimized\\nthrough training. The reconstruction loss quantifies the mean square\\nerror (MSE) between the input and output coordinates, while the KL\\ndivergence tries to approximate the latent space to a standard normal\\ndistribution (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In addition, a scaling term 𝑘 has\\nbeen included in the KL divergence part of the loss function to reduce\\nthe influence of this term. Through Experimenting, we find an optimal\\nvalue of 𝑘 = 5 ⋅ 10−6, see Section 3.3.\\n\\n\\ue232 = \\ue232𝑟𝑒𝑐 + 𝑘 ⋅𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑝 ∥ 𝑞)\\n\\n\\ue232𝑟𝑒𝑐 =\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n𝒚𝑜𝑢𝑡2 − 𝒚𝑖𝑛2\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑝 ∥ 𝑞) = −1\\n𝑛\\n∑\\n\\n(\\n\\n1 + log(𝜎2𝑖 ) − 𝜇2\\n𝑖 − 𝜎2𝑖\\n\\n)\\n\\n.\\n\\n(8)\\n2 𝑖=1\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Control over the bounds of the latent\\nvariables is done by modifying the standard deviation 𝜎 of the normal\\ndistribution. Namely, 𝜎 > 1 generates airfoil shapes that are more likely\\nto be outside the training envelope, while 𝜎 < 1 tends to produce\\nmore conservative airfoil shapes.

In particular, we study the number of latent variables and\\nthe value of the loss scaling parameter.\\n\\n3.3.1. Evaluation metric\\nThe metric used to evaluate the performance of the model is the\\n\\nFréchet distance (FD), frequently used to assess image generation mod-\\nels, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Heusel, Ram-\\nsauer, Unterthiner, Nessler, & Hochreiter, 2017). In the variational\\nautoencoder, it is used to quantify the distance between the generated\\nairfoil distribution, with normal distribution (𝜇𝟏, 𝜎𝟏) and the original\\nirfoil distribution from the UIUC database, with normal distribution\\n𝜇𝟐, 𝜎𝟐):\\n\\n𝐷 = 𝑑2 = ‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n𝜇𝟏 − 𝜇𝟐‖‖\\n2 + 𝑇 𝑟\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝜎𝟏 + 𝜎𝟐 − 2\\n√\\n\\n𝜎𝟏 ⋅ 𝜎𝟐\\n)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nhere 𝜇𝐢 is the mean vector and 𝜎𝐢 is the covariance matrix for each\\nistribution. 𝑇 𝑟 refers to the trace operation. A low value of FD indi-\\nates closeness between the source and generated airfoil distributions\\nnd, therefore, a good generative capacity.\\n\\n.3.2. Loss scaling parameter 𝑘\\nEq. (8) includes a loss scaling parameter 𝑘, that requires tuning. We\\n\\ntudy several base architectures consisting of three hidden layers where\\nhe number of hidden neurons is successively halved (512, 256, 128,\\n4) and depict the results in Fig. 6.

The figure also shows the importance of selecting the\\noss scaling parameter 𝑘. For 𝑘 > 10−2, the Kullback–Leibler divergence\\nerm dominates the loss function and causes the network to always\\nutput the same airfoil for any given input. This results in a stagnation\\nn both the FD and the reconstruction error for large 𝑘. For low values\\n\\nof the scaling term, approximately 𝑘 < 4 ⋅ 10−6, the Fréchet distance\\ntop figure) shows a significant decrease in generative quality.

We observe a sharp increase in the Fréchet\\nistance for 𝑛 < 4 and little improvement for 𝑛 > 4. We keep 𝑛 = 4 latent\\nariables. Note that the latent variables are the variables for shape\\nptimization and thus using a small number leads to fast optimizations.\\n\\n.4. Optimization algorithm\\n\\nTo efficiently explore the global parameter space, an evolution-\\nry algorithm is considered for optimization. In particular, the par-\\nicle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for optimization.\\nSO is a population-based evolutionary heuristic algorithm proposed\\ny Kennedy and Eberhart (1995). It basically describes a simplified\\nocial model that stems from swarm theory, which mimics the swarm\\nf animal adapting to its surrounding environment. Similar to other\\nvolutionary algorithms (Zhou et al., 2011), PSO does not require\\nny gradient information (gradient-free); therefore, it is very useful\\nor global optimization. So far, PSO has been applied to different\\nerodynamic optimization problems (Venter & Sobieszczanski-Sobieski,\\n004; Wickramasinghe, Carrese, & Li, 2010; Xia, Jiang, & Chen, 2017).\\n\\nIn the PSO algorithm, the particles are initially populated at random\\nositions, each represents a candidate optimization solution. The fitness\\nunction is defined to represent the knowledge gained for each particle,\\nhich defines a criterion that determines the proximity of a particle to\\n\\nhe optimal solution. The basic algorithm of PSO is detailed in Kennedy\\nnd Eberhart (1995), which includes four steps as follows:\\n\\n1.

Classical optimization with CST parameterization\\n\\nIn the first group of optimization, the CST parameterization is\\nsed. A NACA0012 airfoil is used for baseline geometry, which has\\neen widely used for case validation. Six CST parameters have been\\nhosen for each surface, to sufficiently represent the geometry. The CST\\narameters for NACA0012 airfoil are shown in Table 2.\\n\\nNote that because of the symmetrical configuration, the CST pa-\\nameters for the lower surface are the negative counterparts of the\\npper surface. From the baseline parameters, we allow ±30% to change\\nhe CST parameters. In the PSO optimization, the number of itera-\\nions/generation is set to 80, while a group of 40 particles is initialized.\\n\\nFig. 9 shows a typical convergence plot in the optimization process.\\ns the PSO iterations progress, the objective function drops first rapidly\\nnd then converges to the minimal values. From the first to the final\\nteration, about 3 dBA noise is reduced for all AOAs.

The same PSO parameters\\nare used during the optimization. As detailed in Section 3.2.2, the\\nautoencoder generates reasonably good aerodynamic configurations\\nacross a wide range of latent variables. Therefore, the range of all\\nfour latent variables is set to [−3, 3]. All PSO parameters are set the\\nsame as those used for CST-based optimization. In contrast to when\\nusing CST-based optimization, the autoencoder provides multiple final\\ngeometries. Three optimum geometries are depicted in Fig. 11. When\\nchecking the aerodynamic coefficients and the OASPL, see Table 3,\\nwe observe that all geometries have similar values for the objective\\nfunction, but the profiles are now different. In this case, the benchmark\\ngeometry is generated by setting all the latent variables to zero (and\\ndoes not correspond to the NACA0012).\\n\\nThe values of all objective functions, including both CST-based\\n(named as Optimized-1/2/3 (CST)) and autoencoder-based (named\\nas Optimized-1/2/3 (AE)) optimization, are summarized in Table 3.\\nAs shown in the table, both types of parameterization lead to very\\nsimilar objective values, but the autoencoder finds more silent airfoils\\n(in particular, the Optimized-1 (AE)). This indicates that when the\\n9\\n\\noptimized airfoil based on autoencoder (e.g., Optimized-1 (AE)) is used\\nfor wind turbine design, significant reduction of noise can be reached\\n(thus reducing human annoyance levels). Indeed, Table 3 shows the\\noverall noise reduction attained by the optimization framework and\\nthe proposed autoencoder-based parameterization, when considering\\nthree angles of attack. In addition, for each of the angle of attack, the\\naerodynamic and acoustic characteristics is compared in Table 4 (for\\nall AOAs used for optimization, including 0◦, 2◦ and 4◦) and Table 5\\n(for other AOAs including 1◦ and 3◦). Since all three results are quite\\nsimilar, only the best result from CST parameterization is included.\\nThese results are plotted in Fig. 12. Although having similar OASPL,\\nthe aerodynamic properties from autoencoder-based optimization are\\nbetter than those from CST-based optimization. Furthermore, the opti-\\nmal airfoil in terms of OASPL (Optimized-1(AE)) reduces around 2.97%\\nfor all angles of attack (the mean value, corresponding to 1.75 dBA),\\ncompared to the baseline NACA0012 airfoil. This indicates that the\\nautoencoder can fully explore the parameter space to generate optimal\\nairfoils. For completeness, the pressure coefficients of all configurations\\nare compared in Fig. 13.\\n\\nTo compare the noise reduction for optimized configurations,\\nFig. 14 shows the far-field noise spectrum. It is clear that, although the\\nintegrated value (OASPL) is used as the objective, the noise across all\\nfrequency ranges is reduced.

At a small angle of attack (e.g., AOA = 0◦), optimized\\nairfoils based on autoencoders show lower noise levels at small frequen-\\ncies, compared to optimized airfoils based on CST. On the contrary, the\\noptimized airfoil based on the third autoencoder shows louder noise at\\nhigh frequencies, similar to the baseline airfoil.

We use PSO in the optimization\\nprocess to ensure an efficient global search. We define the objective\\nfunction of the optimization problem as the OASPL across various\\nAOAs, with aerodynamic and geometric constraints. We introduce\\na variational autoencoder to enhance the shape parameterization of\\nairfoils, to reduce the optimized parameters, and to generate a large\\nfamily of airfoils.\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder finds a large family of optimal ge-\\nometries, whereas the classic CST parameterization converges to very\\nsimilar shapes. Both methods find airfoils with comparable objective\\nfunctions, but the variational autoencoder is superior in better satisfy-\\ning the constraints with improved aerodynamic properties. Compared\\nto the baseline geometry (the NACA0012 airfoil), the autoencoder-\\nbased optimized airfoil reduces by 3% the overall sound pressure\\nlevel (about 1.7 dBA in Overall A-weighted Sound Pressure Level,\\nOASPL), while improving aerodynamic performance. We conclude that\\nthe aeroacoustic optimization framework is a very useful tool for wind\\nturbine airfoil design.\\n\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\n\\nJiaqing Kou: Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Soft-\\nare, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.

Parameters in Amiet’s theory\\n\\n.1. Spanwise correlation length\\n\\nA common methodology to obtain the spanwise correlation length\\ns using Corcos’ model (Corcos, 1964), which depends on an empiri-\\nal constant. This constant can be obtained by fitting the coherence\\netween two sensors located along the span of the airfoil; however,\\nt is usually assumed as a constant value. The spanwise correlation\\nength is related to the distance in the spanwise direction where there\\ns a high level of coherence. It can also be related to the size of\\nhe turbulent structures in the spanwise direction. Theoretically, the\\npanwise correlation length is defined as the integral in the entire span\\nf the coherence between two points in the spanwise direction. It can\\ne calculated from the Corcos’ model for the coherence between two\\npanwise points as:\\n\\n𝑧∣𝑃𝑃 = 𝑏𝑐\\n𝑈𝑐\\n𝜔\\n\\n(A.1)\\n\\nwhere 𝑏𝑐 is the Corco’s constant equal to 1.4.\\n\\nA.2. Wall-pressure spectrum\\n\\nThe wall pressure fluctuations in the vicinity of the trailing edge\\nare the near-field noise source of the far-field noise emitted by an\\nairfoil with an attached and turbulent boundary layer. Therefore, it\\nmight be the most important input of Amiet’s model and critical for\\ngeometry optimization procedures. Therefore, a detailed discussion\\nabout obtaining this quantity is explained in Appendix A.2. They are\\ncaused by velocity fluctuations related to the small structures near the\\nairfoil wall and the larger structures in the outer part of the boundary\\nlayer (Glegg & Devenport, 2017). The smaller structures scale with\\nviscous length (𝑢𝜏∕𝜈) and are responsible for the high frequency range\\nof the wall pressure spectrum, whereas the larger turbulent structures\\nscale with the boundary layer thickness (𝛿) and are responsible for the\\nlow frequency range of the wall pressure spectrum. The mid-frequency\\nrange scales with both types of structures. Based on this theory, several\\n\\nsemiempirical models have been proposed to model the wall pressure\\n\\nhttp://www.upm.es\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119513J.

Other model is the one proposed by Blake\\n(2017) which is based on physical analysis by solving the Poisson’s\\nequation, which governs the relationship between the velocity fluctua-\\ntions across the boundary layer and the wall-pressure fluctuations in the\\nairfoil wall. The model proposed by Blake (2017) was later extended\\nby Parchen (1998) and is now known as the TNO-Blake model. The\\nTNO-Blake model incorporates more physics and takes into account\\nseveral turbulence quantities, and not only integral quantities as in\\nsemiempirical models. For this reason, we retain this model to perform\\nthe optimization procedures presented in this work.\\n\\nThe TNO-Blake model is proposed based on the solution of the\\nPoison equation that results from the divergence of the Navier–Stokes\\nequation simplified by the continuity equation. The model can be\\napplied to calculate the wall-pressure spectrum close to the trailing\\nedge, however, the turbulence quantities are calculated assuming that\\nthe discontinuity of the trailing edge does not affect the turbulence.\\nFurthermore, the model assumes that the turbulent pressure and ve-\\nlocity field are spatially homogeneous and stationary on time. The\\nwall pressure spectrum can be calculated in the wavenumber–frequency\\ndomain by applying the Fourier transform in time–space Fourier trans-\\nform. Therefore, the wall pressure spectrum would depend on the\\nwavenumber in the chordwise direction (𝜅𝑥) and spanwise direction\\n𝜅𝑧). Integration in 𝜅𝑧 can be conducted by introducing the spanwise\\norrelation length that depends on the frequency 𝛬𝑧|𝑝𝑝3(𝜔). In this re-\\nearch, we follow the TNO-Blake model extension proposed by Stalnov\\nt al. (2016), which also considers the anisotropy of the turbulence by\\nncorporating the stretching parameters.\\n\\nThe single-point wall pressure spectrum can be calculated as fol-\\nows:\\n\\npp(𝜔) =\\n4𝜋𝜌2\\n\\n𝛬𝑧∣𝑃𝑃 (𝜔) ∫\\n\\n𝛿\\n\\n0\\n𝛬𝑦∣𝑣𝑣(𝑦)𝑈𝑐 (𝑦)\\n\\n[\\n\\n𝜕𝑈 (𝑦)\\n𝜕𝑦\\n\\n]2\\n\\n×\\n𝑢2𝑦(𝑦)\\n\\n𝑈2\\n𝑐 (𝑦)\\n\\n𝜙𝑣𝑣(𝜅𝑥, 𝜅𝑧 = 0)𝑒−2∣𝜅∣𝑦𝑑𝑦 (A.2)\\n\\nwhere 𝛿 is the thickness of the boundary layer, 𝛬𝑦∣𝑣𝑣(𝑦) is the integral\\nlength scale across the boundary layer in the 𝑦 direction, i.e., in the\\ndirection of the boundary layer, perpendicular to the airfoil wall.
